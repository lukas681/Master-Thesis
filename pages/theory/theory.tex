In this chapter, we will introduce the core definitions used throughout this thesis. 
Most of the definitions of graph theory are taken from Diestel \cite{Diekert2005}. 
For definitions in the area of \textit{parametrized complexity}, the book by Cygan et al.\cite{Cygan2015} gives a very good introduction.
For standard mathematical notation, the reader is referred to any introductory textbook into discrete maths. (for example \cite{Rosen2012})

\section{Graph Theory}

If not explicitly stated otherwise, the following definitions are taken from the book \textit{Graph Theory} written by Reinhard Diestel \cite{diestel10}.

\subsection{Basic Terminology}

\begin{definition}[Graph]
    A simple graph is a pair $G = (V, E)$ of two sets where $V$ denotes the vertices and $E \subseteq V \times V$ the edges of the graph.  A vertex $v \in V$ is incident with an edge $e \in E$ if $v \in e$. Two vertices $x, y$ are adjacent, or neighbours, if $\{x,y \} \in E$. By this definition, graph loops and multiple edges are excluded.
    
    A multigraph is a pair $(V,E)$ of disjoint sets together with a map $E \rightarrow V \cup [V]^2$ assigning to every edge either one or two vertices, its ends. Multigraphs can have loops and multiple edges.
    
    We usually denote the vertex set by $V(G)$ and its edge set by $E(G)$.

\end{definition}

Unless stated otherwise, we usually consider only \textit{simple graphs}, but the notion of \textit{multigraphs} gets important when we later talk about the \textit{underlying multigraph} of a \dreg. 

\begin{definition}[Subgraph and Induced Subgraph]
    Let \G and $G' = (V', E')$ be two graphs. If $V' \subseteq V$ and $E' \subseteq E$ then $G'$ is a \underline{subgraph} of $G$. 
    If $G$ is a subgraph of $G'$ and $G'$ contains all the edges to $G$ with both endpoints in $V(G')$, then $G'$ is an \underline{induced subgraph} of $G$ and we write $G' = G[V(G')]$.
\end{definition}


%TODO Quote
\begin{definition}[Degrees]
    Let \G be a graph. The \textit{degree} $d_G(v)$ (shortly $d(v)$ if $G$ is clear from the context) of a vertex $v \in V$ is the number of neighbors of v. We call a vertex of degree $0$ as \underline{isolated} and one of degree $1$ as a \underline{pendant}. If all the vertices of $G$ have the same degree $k$, then $g$ is $k$-regular.
\end{definition}

% TODO Quote e.g. The open neighborhood number of a graph
\begin{definition}[Closed and Open Neighborhoods {\cite{Balakrishnan2012}}]
    Let \G be a (non-empty) graph. 
    The set of all neighbors of $v$ is the \underline{open neighborhood} of $v$ and denoted by $N(v)$; the set $N[v] = N(v) \cup \{v\}$ is the \underline{closed neighborhood} f $v$ in $G$. When G needs to be made explicit, those open and closed neighborhoods are denoted by $N_G(v)$ and $N_G[v]$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[isomorphic Graphs]
Let \G and $G' = (V', E')$ be two graphs. We call $G$ and $G'$ \underline{isomorphic}, if there exists a bijection $\phi: V \rightarrow V'$ with $\{x, y\} \in E \Leftrightarrow \phi(x)\phi(y) \in E'$ for all  $x,y \in V$. Such a map $\phi$ is called \underline{isomorphism}.

If a graph $G$ is isomorphic to another graph $h$, we denote $G \simeq H$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Paths and Cycles]
    A path is a non-empty graph $P = (V,E)$ of the form $V = \bigcup_{i  \in [k]} \{x_i\}$ and $E = \bigcup_{i \in  [k-1]} \{x_ix_{i+1}\}$ where the $x_i$ are distinct. The vertices $x_0$ and $x_k$ are \underline{linked} by $P$ and are called the \textit{ends} of $P$. The \underline{length} of a path is its number of edges and the path on $n$ vertices is denoted by  $P_n$. We refer to a path $P$ by a natural sequence of its vertices: $P = x_0x_1...x_k$. Such a path $P$ is a path between $x_0$ and $x_k$, or a $x_0,x_k$-path.
    If $P = x_0...x_k$ is a path and $k \geq 2$, the graph with vertex set $V(P)$ and edge set $E(P) \cup \{x_kx_0\}$ is a \underline{cycle}. The cycle on $n$ vertices is denoted as $C_n$.
    The \underline{distance} $d_G(v,w)$ from a vertex $v$ to a vertex $w$ in a graph $g$ is the length of the shortest path between $v$ and $w$. If $v$ and $w$ are not linked by any path in $G$, we set $d_G(v,w) = \infty$. Again, if $G$ is clear from the context, we omit the subscripted $G$ and just write $d(v,w)$ instead.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Graph Classes}

A \textit{graph class} is a set of graphs $\mathfrak{G}$ that is closed under isomorphism that is if $G \in \mathfrak{G}$ and a $H \simeq G$ then $H \in \mathfrak{G}$ as well. 

\begin{definition}[Graph Parameters]
Let \G be a graph.
An  \underline{independent set} of $G$ is a set of pairwise non-adjacent vertices. 
A \underline{clique} of $G$ is a set of pairwise adjacent vertices. 
A \underline{vertex cover} of $G$ is a subset of vertices containing at least one endpoint of every edge. 
A \underline{dominating set} is a subset $D$ of vertices such that all vertices not contained in are adjacent to some vertex in $D$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[r-partite Graphs]
    Let $r \geq 2$ be an integer. A Graph $G = (V, E)$ is called \underline{r-partite} if $V$ admits a partition into $r$ classes such that every edge has its ends in different classes: Vertices in the same partition class must not be adjacent. 
    A \textit{$2$-partite} graph is called \underline{bipartite}. 
    
    An $r$-partite graph in which every two vertices from different partition classes are adjacent is called \underline{complete}. For the \underline{complete bipartite graph} on bipartitions $X \uplus Y$ of size $m$ and $n$, we shortly write $K_{m,n}$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Complete Graph]
If all vertices of a graph \G are pairwise adjacent, we say that $G$ is \underline{complete}. 
A complete graph on $n$ vertices is a $K_n$. A $K_3$ is called a \underline{triangle}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Chordal Graphs]
For a graph \G, an edge that joins two vertices of a cycle, but is not itself an edge of the cycle is a \underline{chord} of that cycle.

Furthermore, we say $G$ is \underline{chordal} (or \textit{triangulated}) if each of its cycles of length at least four has a chord. In other words, it contains no induced cycle other than triangles.

\end{definition}
Chordal graphs have some nice properties:

\begin{definition}[Split Graphs]
A \underline{split graph} is a graph \G whose vertices can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set.    
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Path Graph $P_i$]
    
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Bipartite Graph, {\cite[p.5]{Bondy2008}}]
    
A \textit{\bg} is a Graph G whose vertex set can be partitioned into two subsets X and Y, so that each edge has one end in X and one end in Y. Such a partition (X,Y) is called a \textit{bipartition} of G.

\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[Complete Graph]
    
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Perfect Graphs]
    
\end{definition}

Of high importance for this thesis is the class of planar graphs.

\begin{definition}[Planar Graphs]

A \textit{plane graph} is a pair $(V,E)$ of finite sets with the following properties:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ (Vertices).
    \vspace{-2mm}
    \item Every edge is an arc between two vertices, 
    \vspace{-2mm}
    \item different edges have different sets of endpoints, and
    \vspace{-2mm}
    \item The interior of an edge contains no vertex and no point of any other edge
\end{itemize}

An embedding in the plane, or \textit{planar embedding}, of an (abstract) graph $G$ is an isomorphism between $G$ and a plane graph $H$. A \textit{plane graph} can be seen as a concrete \textbf{embedding} of the planar graph into the ``plane'' $\mathbb{R}^2$.
