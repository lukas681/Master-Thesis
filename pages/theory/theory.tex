\chapter{Terminology Preliminaries}
In this chapter, we will introduce the core definitions used in this thesis. 
Most of the definitions of graph theory are taken from Diestel \cite{Diekert2005}. 
For definitions in the area of \textit{parametrized complexity}, the book by Cygan et al. \cite{Cygan2015} gives a very good introduction.

\section{Graph Theory}
% In 1736, Euler Örst introduced the notion of graph theory. In the history of mathematics, the solution given by Euler of the well known Konigsberg bridge problem is
%kconsidered to be the Örst theorem of graph theory. This has now become a subject
%kgenerally regarded as a branch of a combinatorics. The theory of graph is an extremely
%kuseful tool for solving combinatorial problems in di§erent areas such as geometry, algebra, number theory, topology, operations research, optimization and computer science.

We quickly state the following definitions given by {\cite[p.~xxx]{diestel10}}.

\begin{definition}[Graph {\cite[p. 3]{diestel10}}]
    A graph is a pair $G = (V, E)$ of two sets where $V$ denotes the vertices and $E \subseteq V \times V$ the edges of the graph.  A vertex $v \in V$ is incident with an edge $e \in E$ if $v \in e$. Two vertices $x, y$ are adjacent, or neighbours, if $\{x,y \} \in E$.

\begin{definition}[Vertex Degrees]
    The \textit{degree} $d_G(v)$ (If G is clear, also $d(v)$) of a vertex $v$ is the number of neighbors of v. We call a vertex of degree 0 as isolated and one of degree 1 as a pendant.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[isomorphic Graphs, {\cite*[p. 3]{diestel10}}]
Let \G and $G' = (V', E')$ be two graph. We call $G$ and $G'$ \underline{isomorphic}, if there exists a bijection $\phi: V \rightarrow V'$ with $\{x, y\} \in E \Leftrightarrow \phi(x)\phi(y) \in E'$ for all  $x,y \in V$. Such a map $\phi$ is called \underline{isomorphism}.
\end{definition}
If a graph $G$ is isomorphic to another graph $h$, we denote $G \simeq H$. 

\begin{definition}[Special Graph Notations {\cite[p.~27]{diestel10}}]
    A simple Graph
    
    A directed Graph is a graph
    
    A Multi Graph
    
    A Planar Graph
\end{definition}

% TODO Quote e.g. The open neighborhood number of a graph
\begin{definition}[Closed and Open Neighborhoods {\cite{Balakrishnan2012}}]
    Let \G be a (non-empty) graph. 
    The set of all neighbors of $v$ is the \underline{open neighborhood} of $v$ and denoted by $N(v)$; the set $N[v] = N(v) \Cup \{v\}$ is the \underline{closed neighborhood} f $v$ in $G$. When G needs to be made explicit, those open and closed neighborhoods are denoted by $N_G(v)$ and $N_G[v]$.

\subsection*{Graph Classes}

We call the class of graphs without any special restrictions ``General Graphs''.

\begin{definition}[r-partite Graphs]
    Let $r \geq 2$ be an integer. A Graph $G = (V,E)$ is called ``r-partite'' if V admits a partition into r classes such that every edge has its ends in different classes: Vertices in the same partition class must not be adjacent. 
    
    For the case $r = 2$ we say that the G is ``bipartite''

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Chordal Graphs]
    
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Split Graphs]
    
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Path Graph $P_i$]
    
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Bipartite Graph, {\cite[p.5]{Bondy2008}}]
    
A \textit{\bg} is a Graph G whose vertex set can be partitioned into two subsets X and Y, so that each edge has one end in X and one end in Y. Such a partition (X,Y) is called a \textit{bipartition} of G.

\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[Planar Graphs {\cite[Chapter 4]{diestel10}}]

A \textit{plane graph} is a pair $(V,E)$ of finite sets with the following properties:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ (Vertices)
    \item Every edge is an arc between two vertices 
    \item different edges have different sets of endpoints
    \item The interior of an edge contains no vertex and no point of any other edge
\end{itemize}

An embedding in the plane, or \textit{planar embedding}, of an (abstract) graph $G$ is an isomorphism between $G$ and a plane graph $H$. A \textit{plane graph} can be seen as a concrete \textbf{embedding} of the planar graph into the ``plane'' $\mathbb{R}^2$.
