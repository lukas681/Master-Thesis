In this chapter, we will introduce the core definitions used throughout this thesis. 
Most of the definitions of graph theory are taken from \cite{Diekert2005}. 
For definitions in the area of \textit{parameterized complexity}, the book written by Cygan et al. \cite{Cygan2015} gives an excellent introduction.
For standard mathematical notation, the reader is referred to any introductory textbook into discrete mathematics (e.g. \cite{Rosen2012}).

\section{Graph Theory}

If not explicitly stated otherwise, the following definitions are taken from the book \textit{Graph Theory} written by Reinhard Diestel \cite{diestel10}.

\subsection{Basic Terminology}

\begin{definition}[Graph]
    A simple graph is a pair $G = (V, E)$ of two sets where $V$ denotes the vertices and $E \subseteq V \times V$ the edges of the graph.  A vertex $v \in V$ is incident with an edge $e \in E$ if $v \in e$. Two vertices $x, y$ are adjacent, or neighbours, if $\{x,y \} \in E$. By this definition, graph loops and multiple edges are excluded.
    
    A multigraph is a pair $(V, E)$ of disjoint sets together with a map $E \rightarrow V \cup [V]^2$ assigning to every edge either one or two vertices, its ends. Multigraphs can have loops and multiple edges.
    
    We usually denote the vertex set by $V(G)$ and its edge set by $E(G)$.


    % TODO connected 

\end{definition}

Unless stated otherwise, we usually consider only \textit{simple graphs}, but the notion of \textit{multigraphs} gets important when we later talk about the \textit{underlying multigraph} of a \dreg. 

\begin{definition}[Subgraph and Induced Subgraph]
    Let \G and $G' = (V', E')$ be two graphs. If $V' \subseteq V$ and $E' \subseteq E$ then $G'$ is a \underline{subgraph} of $G$. 
    If $G$ is a subgraph of $G'$ and $G'$ contains all the edges to $G$ with both endpoints in $V(G')$, then $G'$ is an \underline{induced subgraph} of $G$ and we write $G' = G[V(G')]$.
\end{definition}


%TODO Quote
\begin{definition}[Degrees]
    Let \G be a graph. The \textit{degree} $d_G(v)$ (shortly $d(v)$ if $G$ is clear from the context) of a vertex $v \in V$ is the number of neighbors of v. We call a vertex of degree $0$ as \underline{isolated} and one of degree $1$ as a \underline{pendant}. If all the vertices of $G$ have the same degree $k$, then $g$ is $k$-regular.
\end{definition}

% TODO Quote e.g. The open neighborhood number of a graph
\begin{definition}[Closed and Open Neighborhoods {\cite{Balakrishnan2012}}]
    Let \G be a (non-empty) graph. 
    The set of all neighbors of $v$ is the \underline{open neighborhood} of $v$ and denoted by $N(v)$; the set $N[v] = N(v) \cup \{v\}$ is the \underline{closed neighborhood} f $v$ in $G$. When G needs to be made explicit, those open and closed neighborhoods are denoted by $N_G(v)$ and $N_G[v]$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[isomorphic Graphs]
Let \G and $G' = (V', E')$ be two graphs. We call $G$ and $G'$ \underline{isomorphic}, if there exists a bijection $\phi: V \rightarrow V'$ with $\{x, y\} \in E \Leftrightarrow \phi(x)\phi(y) \in E'$ for all  $x,y \in V$. Such a map $\phi$ is called \underline{isomorphism}.

If a graph $G$ is isomorphic to another graph $h$, we denote $G \simeq H$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Paths and Cycles]
    A path is a non-empty graph $P = (V,E)$ of the form $V = \bigcup_{i  \in [k]} \{x_i\}$ and $E = \bigcup_{i \in  [k-1]} \{x_ix_{i+1}\}$ where the $x_i$ are distinct. The vertices $x_0$ and $x_k$ are \underline{linked} by $P$ and are called the \textit{ends} of $P$. The \underline{length} of a path is its number of edges and the path on $n$ vertices is denoted by  $P_n$. We refer to a path $P$ by a natural sequence of its vertices: $P = x_0x_1...x_k$. Such a path $P$ is a path between $x_0$ and $x_k$, or a $x_0,x_k$-path.
    If $P = x_0...x_k$ is a path and $k \geq 2$, the graph with vertex set $V(P)$ and edge set $E(P) \cup \{x_kx_0\}$ is a \underline{cycle}. The cycle on $n$ vertices is denoted as $C_n$.
    The \underline{distance} $d_G(v,w)$ from a vertex $v$ to a vertex $w$ in a graph $g$ is the length of the shortest path between $v$ and $w$. If $v$ and $w$ are not linked by any path in $G$, we set $d_G(v,w) = \infty$. Again, if $G$ is clear from the context, we omit the subscripted $G$ and just write $d(v,w)$ instead.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Graph Classes}

A \textit{graph class} is a set of graphs $\mathfrak{G}$ that is closed under isomorphism that is if $G \in \mathfrak{G}$ and a $H \simeq G$ then $H \in \mathfrak{G}$ as well.

\begin{definition}[Graph Parameters]
Let \G be a graph.
An  \underline{independent set} of $G$ is a set of pairwise non-adjacent vertices. 
A \underline{clique} of $G$ is a set of pairwise adjacent vertices. 
A \underline{vertex cover} of $G$ is a subset of vertices containing at least one endpoint of every edge. 
A \underline{dominating set} is a subset $D$ of vertices such that all vertices not contained in are adjacent to some vertex in $D$.
\end{definition}

\begin{graphclass}[r-partite]
    Let $r \geq 2$ be an integer. A Graph $G = (V, E)$ is called \underline{r-partite} if $V$ admits a partition into $r$ classes such that every edge has its ends in different classes: Vertices in the same partition class must not be adjacent. 
    A \textit{$2$-partite} graph is called \underline{bipartite}. 
    
    An $r$-partite graph in which every two vertices from different partition classes are adjacent is called \underline{complete}. For the \underline{complete bipartite graph} on bipartitions $X \uplus Y$ of size $m$ and $n$, we shortly write $K_{m,n}$. 
\end{graphclass}

\begin{graphclass}[Complete]
If all vertices of a graph \G are pairwise adjacent, we say that $G$ is \underline{complete}. 
A complete graph on $n$ vertices is a $K_n$. A $K_3$ is called a \underline{triangle}.
\end{graphclass}


%\begin{definition}[{\cite[IV. Triangulated Graphs]{Berge1966}}]
%    A graph G is called \textit{chordal} (or in the older literature \textit{triangulated}) graphs if for every cycle $c = [p_1,...,p_n,p_1]$ of length $l > 3$ there is an edge of $G$ joining two non-consecutive vertices of c. Such vertices are called chords of the cycle   
%\end{definition}

\begin{graphclass}[Chordal]
For a graph \G, an edge that joins two vertices of a cycle, but is not itself an edge of the cycle is a \underline{chord} of that cycle.

Furthermore, we say $G$ is \underline{chordal} (or \textit{triangulated}) if each of its cycles of length at least four has a chord. In other words, it contains no induced cycle other than triangles.

\end{graphclass}

\begin{graphclass}[Split]
A \underline{split graph} is a graph \G whose vertices can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set.    
\end{graphclass}

%\begin{graphclass}[Bipartite {\cite[p.5]{Bondy2008}}]
%A \textit{\bg} is a Graph G whose vertex set can be partitioned into two subsets X and Y, so that each edge has one end in X and one end in Y. Such a partition (X,Y) is called a \textit{bipartition} of G.
%\end{graphclass}

%\begin{definition}[Perfect Graphs]
    
%\end{definition}

\begin{graphclass}[Planar]

A \textit{plane graph} is a pair $(V,E)$ of finite sets with the following properties:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ (Vertices),
    \vspace{-2mm}
    \item Every edge is an arc between two vertices, 
    \vspace{-2mm}
    \item different edges have different sets of endpoints, and
    \vspace{-2mm}
    \item The interior of an edge contains no vertex and no point of any other edge
\end{itemize}

An embedding in the plane, or \textit{planar embedding}, of an (abstract) graph $G$ is an isomorphism between $G$ and a plane graph $H$. A \textit{plane graph} can be seen as a concrete \textbf{embedding} of the planar graph into the ``plane'' $\mathbb{R}^2$.

In connection with various chessboard problems, the concept of domination can be traced back to the mid-1800s.
For example, De Jaenosch attempted in 1862 to solve the minimum number of queens required to fully cover an $n \times n$-chessboard \cite{Jaenisch1862}.
Because of the immense amount of publications related to domination that followed, Haynes, Hedetniemi, and Slater started a comprehensive survey of the literature in 1998 \cite{Haynes1998, Haynes1998b}. 
20 years later, by a series of three more books, Haynes, Henning and Hedetniemi complemented the survey with the latest developments \cite{Haynes2020, Haynes2021, Haynes2022}.

We are now introducing the problems of \dom, \sdom and \tdom and dedicate the rest of the chapter to giving a current status about the complexity status of various graph classes. 

% We will see that most cases mirror each other for the three different problems, but sometimes there seems to be 

% Surprisingly, there are cases where the complexity of \dom and \tdom differes (e)
%If both \dom and \tdom are already hard for a class, we already have a strong assumption that this also holds for \sdom as well.

%Interestingly, most of them mimic each other for one specific class, but there are some exceptions, where this is not the case.

\section{Domination Problems}

We are now going to define the three most important domination problems for this work: \dom, \sdom and \tdom.
Recall that a dominating set of a graph \G is a subset $D \subseteq V$, such that every vertex $V \setminus D$ is adjacent to some vertex in $D$.
We say that a vertex $d$ is a \textit{dominating vertex} or \textit{dominator} if $d \in D$ and that $d$ \textit{dominates} all of its neighbors.

The \dom problem asks for a subset $D$ of size at most $k$ of vertices whose set of neighbors are adjacent o all the other vertices.
In other words: every vertex $v \notin D$ needs to have at least one neighbor in $D$.

\begin{prb}[\DOM~{\cite[p. 586]{Cygan2015}}]{prb:ds}
    \begin{tabularx}{1.0\textwidth}{>{\hsize=0.30\hsize}X>{\hsize=0.8\hsize}X}
        \textbf{Input} & Graph \G, $k \in \mathbb{N}$\\
        \textbf{Question} & Is there a set {$X \subseteq V$} of size at most $k$ such that ${N[X] = V}$? \\
    \end{tabularx}
\end{prb}

If we also demand the dominating vertices to be dominated, need the notion of \tdomin.
The \tdom problem adds one additional constraint: Every vertex $v \in D$ in the dominating set must also be dominated by some vertex $v' \in D$ which we call the \textit{witness} of $v$.

\begin{prb}[\TDOM~{\cite[p. 596]{Cygan2015}}]{prb:sds}
    \begin{tabularx}{1.0\textwidth}{>{\hsize=0.30\hsize}X>{\hsize=0.8\hsize}X}
        \textbf{Input} & Graph \G, $k \in \mathbb{N}$\\
        \textbf{Question} & Does there exists a set $X \subseteq V$ with $\abs{X}\leq k$ vertices such that for every $u \in V(G)$ there exists $v \in X$ with $\{u,v\} \in E$? \\
    \end{tabularx}
\end{prb}

Finally, \sdomin was introduced by Goddard, Henning and McPillan \cite{Goddard2014} as a relaxation of \tdomin. 
Assume that we have an arbitrary dominating set $D$ for some (connected) graph \G that has size at most two.
It is easy to observe that for each $v \in D$ there must be at least one other dominating vertex $v' \in D$ that is at most three steps away because otherwise, this would not be a dominating set. 
On the other side, by definition of a total dominating set $D$, every dominating vertex $d \in D$ has another vertex in $d' \in N(d) \cap D$ that is also dominating.
It is natural to ask what happens if we restrict this distance property to be at most two, which leads us straight to the idea of \sdomin.
For a semitotal dominating set $D$, we say that $v$ witnesses $v'$ if $v,v' \in D$ and $d(v,v') \leq 2$.

\begin{prb}[\SDOM~{\cite{Goddard2014}}]{prb:tds}
    \begin{tabularx}{1.0\textwidth}{>{\hsize=0.30\hsize}X>{\hsize=0.8\hsize}X}
        \textbf{Input} & Graph \G, $k \in \mathbb{N}$\\
        \textbf{Question} & Is there a subset $X \subseteq V$ with $\abs{X} \leq k$ such that ${N[X] = V}$ and for all $d_1 \in X$ there exists another $d_2 \in X$ such that ${d(d_1, d_2) \leq 2}$?\\
    \end{tabularx}
\end{prb}

\Cref{fig:dsexamples} demonstrates that the minimum ds, sds and tds can strictly differ in the size on a fixed graph \G. a minimum ds (left) does not need any witnesses at all and we can choose $d_1$ and $d_2$ to dominate the graph. 
As $d(d_1, d_2) = 3$, we have to introduce additional dominating vertices for a minimum sds (middle) and tds (right). 
Their only purpose is, to bridge the gap between $d_1$ and $d_2$.
% In a sds it is enough to use $d_3$, because $d(d_2,d_3) < d(d_1, d_3) \leq 2$.

In the first case, only two vertices suffice to dominate all others. In the second one, we need a witness between $d_1$ and $d_2$ that is at most distance two. In the last case, $d_1$ and $d_2$ both need a neighbor in the total dominating set.}}
    \label{fig:dsexamples}
\end{figure}


\begin{definition}[Domination Numbers]
   The \underline{domination number} in a graph $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a dominating set (ds) of $G$, denoted as $\gamma(G)$. 
   The \underline{total domination number} is the minimum cardinality of a total dominating set (tds) of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_t(G)$.
   The \underline{semitotal domination number} is the minimum cardinality of a semitotal dominating set (sds) of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_t(G)$.

   We say that a ds $D$ is \underline{minimal} if no proper subset $S' \subset S$ is a ds and that $D$ is a \underline{minimum} if it is the smallest ds.
\end{definition}

Because any tds is also an sds and every sds is also a ds, $\gamma{t2}$ is squeezed between $\gamma$ and $\gamma_t$.
The  following fact was first observed by Goddard and Henning \cite{Goddard2014}:

\begin{fact}
For every graph $G$ with no isolated vertex, $\gamma(G) \leq \gamma_{t2}(G) \leq \gamma_t(G)$
\end{fact}
It turns out that for some graphs, all of these inequalities are strict. See \cref{figd:dsexamples} for an example, where $\gamma < \gamma_{t2} < \gamma_t$ and therefore.

\section{Complexity Status of \sdom}\label{ch:complexity-status}

We will now summarize the current result:

% Surprisingly, there are cases where the complexity of \dom and \tdom differes (e)
%If both \dom and \tdom are already hard for a class, we already have a strong assumption that this also holds for \sdom as well.

As any \bg with bipartition can be split further into \rpg this results also implies the \wone-hardness of \rpg
