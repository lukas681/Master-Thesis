\section{Computational Complexity Theory}

Computational complexity investigates how many computational resources are required to solve a specific problem. 
We are about to introduce two of the most important classes of problems in classical complexity theory:

\begin{cc}[The Classes \Pt and \NP~{\cite{Arora2006}}]{cc:pnp}

    If we denote \DTIME as the set of decision problems that are solvable in $\mathcal{O}(n^k)$ time by a deterministic Turing Machine, we can define the class \Pt as:

    \[ \mathrm{P} := \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}}(\mathrm{DTIME}(n^k))\]


    \noindent A language $L \subseteq \{0,1\}^*$ is in \NP if there exists a polynomial $p: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ and a polynomial-time Turing Machine $M$ such that for every $x \in \{0,1\}^*$,

    \[ x \in L \Leftrightarrow \exists u \in \{0,1\}^{p(|x|)} \mathnormal{s.t.~} M(x,u) = 1 \]

    \noindent If $x \in L$ and $u \in \{ 0,1 \}^{p(|x|)}$ satisfy $M(x,u) = 1$, then we call $u$  a \textit{certificate} for $x$.

\end{cc}

\Pt denotes the class of all problems that are \textit{efficiently solvable}, whereas \NP contains all problems whose solution can efficiently be verified. Note that $\Pt \subseteq \NP$, but the opposite is unknown.
\subsection{\NPcn}\label{ch:npc}
A significant discovery in the early 1970s was that some problems in \NP are \textit{at least as hard as} as any other problem in \NP. By spanning a whole ``web of reductions'' \cite{Arora2006} we get strong evidence that none of these problems can be solved efficiently.
The first results in this new field were published independently by Cook \cite{Cook1971} and Levin \cite{Levin1973} after Karp \cite{Karp1972} had introduced the notion of problem reductions.
The Cook-Levin-Theorem \cite{Cook1971} proved that the \SAT (\SATs) problem is \NPc any problem in $NP$ can be reduced to \SATs. 
A single algorithm for one of these problems \NPc problems would instantly give a fast algorithm for the others as well. 
We refer the reader to \cite{Arora2006} for a comprehensive introduction to classical complexity theory.

\begin{definition}[{Reductions, \NP-hardness and \NPcn \cite{Arora2006}}]
We say that a language $A\subseteq \{0,1\}^*$ is \textit{polynomial-time karp reducible} to a language $B \subseteq \{0,1\}^*$ (denote $A \leq_p B$) if there is a poly-time computable function $f: \{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \{0,1\}^*$ such that for every $x \in \{0,1\}^*$, $x \in A$ if and only if $f(x) \in B$.

\noindent We say that a problem $B$ is \NPh if $A \leq_p B$ for every $A \in \NP$ and $B$ is \NPc if additionally $B \in NP$ holds.

\end{definition}
There are thousands of \NPc problems we do not expect to be solvable in polynomial time.
Whether $\Pt \overset{?}{=} \NP$ is still one of the biggest open questions in mathematics and bountied with one million dollars by the \textit{Clay Mathematical Institute} \cite{Fortnow2021}. 
Most of the domination problems like \dom, \sdom, \tdom are \NPc.

% \paragraph{Coping With \NPcn}

We do not expect \NPc problems to have a polynomial-time algorithm, but strategies exist to cope with them. 
We can either give up the exactness of a solution to possibly find fast \textit{approximation algorithms} or abandon the search for a polynomial-time algorithm in favor of finding good \textit{Exact Exponential (EEA) Algorithms} instead.
A third technique is using additional structural parameters of a specific problem instance and therefore \textbf{restricting the input to special cases}. 
This idea led to the development of \textit{parameterized complexity}.

\section{Parameterized Complexity}\label{cha:param}

Introduced by Downey and Fellows \cite{Downey1999a}, parameterized complexity extends the classical theory with a framework that allows a more dimensional analysis of computationally hard problems. 
The idea is to extract an arbitrary parameter $k$ and find an algorithm that is only exponential in a function $f(k)$ but only polynomial in the instance size.
$k$ denotes how complex the problem is: 
$k$ can be seen as a measure of the difficulty of a given instance.
If $k$ is small, the problem can still be considered tractable, although the underlying \NPh problem is generally intractable.
All definitions are taken from \cite{Cygan2015} if not marked otherwise.

\begin{definition}[Parameterized Problem]
    A parameterized problem is a language $L\subseteq\Sigma^*\times \mathbb{N}$ where $\Sigma$ is a finite, fixed alphabet.
    For an instance $(x,k) \in \Sigma^*\times \mathbb{N}$, $k$ is called the \textit{parameter}.

    The \underline{size of an instance} of an instance $(x,k)$ of a parameterized problem is $\abs{(x,k)} = \abs{x} + k$ where the parameter $k$ is encoded in unary by convention.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Fixed-Parameter Tractability}
We say that a problem is \textit{fixed-parameter tractable (fpt)} if problem instances of size $n$ can be solved in $f(k)n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ time for some function $f$ independent of $n$. 
Like the class \Pt can be seen as a notion of \textit{tractability} in classical complexity theory, there is an equivalent in parameterized complexity, which we denote as \FPTl (\FPT):

\begin{cc} [The Class \FPT]{cc:fpt}
    A parameterized problem $L\subseteq\Sigma^*\times\mathbb{N}$ is called \textit{fixed-parameter tractable} if there exists an algorithm A (called a \textit{fixed-parameter algorithm}), a computable function $f:\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ and a constant c such that, given $(x,k) \in \Sigma^* \times \mathbb{N}$, the algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ correctly decides whether $(x,k) \in L$ in time bounded by $f(k) \cdot |(x,k)|^c$. The complexity class containing all fixed-parameter tractable problems is called \FPT.
\end{cc}
\subsection{Kernelization}

A kernelization algorithm is a natural and intuitive way to approach problems and is a preprocessing procedure that simplifies parts of an instance before the actual solving algorithm runs. 
The \cref{fig:kernelization} visualizes this idea.
One can introduce different \textit{reduction rules} that iteratively reduce the instance until we are left with a small kernel. 
Ideally, the size of this kernel is merely dependent on the parameter $k$.

\begin{definition}[Kernelization and Reduction Rules]
A \textit{kernelization algorithm} or \textit{kernel} is an algorithm $\mathfrak{A}$ for a parameterized problem $Q$ that given an instance $(I,k)$ of $Q$ runs in polynomial time and returns an equivalent instance $(I', k')$ of $Q$. 
Moreover, we require that $size_{\mathfrak{A}}(k) \leq g(k)$ for some computable function $g:\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$.

A \underline{reduction rule} is a function $\phi:\Sigma^* \times \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \Sigma^* \times \mathbb{N}$ that maps an instance $(x,k)$ to an equivalent instance $(x',k')$ such that $\phi$ is computable in time polynomial in $\abs{x}$ and $k$.
A reduction rule is \underline{sound} (or \underline{safe}) if $(I, k) \in Q \Leftrightarrow (I',k') \in Q$.
\end{definition}

We can precisely define the kernel's size after executing a preprocessing algorithm $\mathfrak{A}$.

\begin{definition}[Output Size of a Preprocessing Algorithm] The output size of a preprocessing algorithms $\mathfrak{A}$ is defined as 

    \[\mathrm{size}_{\mathfrak{A}}(k) = \sup\{\abs{I'} + k': (I',k')= \mathfrak{A}(I,k), I \in \Sigma^* \} \]
\end{definition}


$size_{\mathfrak{A}}$ denotes the largest size of any instance $I$ after $\mathfrak{A}$ has been applied.
If no function merely dependent on $k$ can bound it, we consider it to be \emph{infinite}.
If we bound $\mathrm{size}_{\mathfrak{A}}$ by a polynomial in $k$, we say that the problem admits a \textbf{polynomial kernel} or a \textbf{linear} kernel analogously.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{fig/mathcha/kernelization.tikz}
    \caption[Idea of kernelization]{\textit{The Idea of Kernelization: Reducing an instance $(I,k) \in Q$ of size $n$ to a smaller instance $(I', k') \in Q$ in polynomial time. 
    The resulting size of the kernel is a function $g(k)$ only dependent on $k$.}
    }
    \label{fig:kernelization}
\end{figure}
The following \cref{lemma:fptiskernel} shows the relation between the complexity class \FPT and a kernelization algorithm. 
If we find a kernelization algorithm $\mathfrak{A}$ for a (decidable) problem $P$, we immediately obtain an fpt algorithm.
First, we will run $\mathfrak{A}$ on the given instance in polynomial time and then solve the kernel with an exponential time algorithm.
The total running time is of order $\mathcal{O}(g(f(k)) \cdot \mathrm{poly}(n))$ and hence, fpt.
Surprisingly, also the converse is true:

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:fptiskernel}
    A parameterized problem $Q$ is \FPT if and only if it admits a kernelization algorithm.
\end{lemma}

 We will use this property in \cref{ch:linkern} to construct a kernel for \psdom and showing membership in \FPT.

\subsection{Reductions and Parameterized Intractability}

It is natural to ask whether all (hard) problems are also fixed-parameter tractable.
The answer is no, and parameterized complexity has another tool to show that a problem is unlikely to be in \FPT.
The idea is to transfer the concepts of \NP-hardness from \Cref{ch:npc} and reductions from the classical setting to the parameterized world.
This raises the need for a new type of reduction that ensures that a reduced instance $(I', k')$ is not only created in fpt time, but the new parameter $k'$ depends only on the size of the parameter in the original instance.

There exists a whole hierarchy of classes $\FPT \subseteq \WONE \subseteq \WTWO \subseteq ... \subseteq \Wt \subseteq ...$, which is known as the \WHIERARCHY.
It is strongly believed that $\FPT \subsetneq \Wt$ and therefore, we do not expect the existence of an algorithm solving any \Wt-hard problem in fpt time.

\begin{definition}[Parameterized Reduction] Let $A,B\subseteq \Sigma^*\times\mathbb{N}$ two parameterized problems. A \textit{parameter preserving reduction} from $A$ to $B$ is an algorithm that, given an instance $(x,k)$ of $A$, outputs an instance $(x', k')$ of $B$ such that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $(x,k)$ is a \textcolor{darkgray}{\textbf{yes instance}} of A \textbf{iff} $(x',k')$ is a \textcolor{darkgray}{\textbf{yes instance}} of B,
        \item $k' \leq g(k)$ for some computable function $g$, and
        \item runs in fpt-time $f(k)\cdot |x|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ for some computable function f.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\cref{lem:cfptr,lem:trans} shwon in \cite{Cygan2015} show this definition ensures that reductions are transitive and closed under fpt reductions.

\begin{lemma}[Closed Under fpt-reductions]\label{lem:cfptr}
    If there is a parameterized reduction from $A$ to $B$ and $B \in \FPT$, then $A \in \FPT$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Transitivity] \label{lem:trans}
    If there are parameterized reductions from $A$ to $B$ and from $B$ to $C$, then there is a parameterized reduction from $A$ to $C$.
\end{lemma}

If there exists a parameterized reduction transforming a \Wt-hard problem $A$ to another problem $B$, then $B$ is \Wt-hard as well.
We can define the classes \WONE and \WTWO by giving two problems that are complete for these classes.

\begin{cc}[The Classes \WONE ~{\cite{Downey1995}} and \WTWO ~{\cite{Cygan2015}}]{cc:wi}\begin{align*}
        \\[-2em] & \\[-3em]
        \text{\is is } &\text{\WONE-complete.}\\
        \text{\dom is } &\text{\WTWO-complete.}
    \end{align*}
    A problem $P$ is in the class \WONE (resp. \WTWO) if there is a parameterized reduction from $P$ to \is (\dom).
\end{cc}

A more profound introduction is not required for this work, and we refer the interested reader to \cite{Cygan2015, Fomin2019} for more details.
