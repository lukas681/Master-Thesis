Quack! Quack! They were careless for a second and immediately the \textit{dreaded geesiosi} clan has taken the opportunity and conquered your befriended ducks' \textit{Merganser Lake}!
Now they are sitting on all the beautiful water lilies refusing to give them back and the desperate ducks have asked for your assistance!
The ducks have given you a map of the lake (see the left side of \cref{fig:duck-lake}) and marked all the water lilies in green.
You instantly assured to help and started to analyze their situation!

Additionally, you see that the \textit{geesiosi} members are very frightened of the ducks' quacking and you conclude that one single duck could free up an entire water lily by sitting there driving away all the geese on neighboring plants! 
After thinking about this for a while you realized that this might indeed be the key observation to regaining the lake. 
After some more deep contemplating, you came up with a good assignment of ducks to water lilies, where only a minimum number of ducks is required to liberate the whole territory again.

Happy with your idea, you present it to the \textit{Supreme Duck Decision Board}, but unfortunately, you could not fully convince them and the \textit{Chief Strategy Duck} shared her worries with you: 
``We have to hold the fort and protect the lake against another future rush of the \textit{geesiosi}!'', they said, ``and it is a very tedious task  to sit alone at a water lily waiting the whole day! They would rather want to have at least someone around to quack with together!''
%____

You suggest revising your solution making sure that there is always another friend sitting at most two water lilies away. After a short retreat, you came up with a new solution where only two warrior ducks (see the right side of \cref{fig:duck-lake}) are required and they only have one lily in between. 

The ducks were fully satisfied with the solution now! 
But while you see the chosen two ducks being sent out over the water's surface, you were still thinking about the problem.
It looked so easy at first, but in the end, you had to try all the possible configurations while playing around with the number of ducks used (of course you did not tell the ducks that it was that simple, because they now think you are a wizard!).
You wonder whether there is a way to significantly reduce the number of configurations you have to try to find a solution.

Back in your library, you read in ancient scrolls that this problem has already been formalized by Henning \cite{Henning2019} as the \sdom problem which is a variant of the intensively studied \dom problem. 
You read that both problems are \NPc~\cite{Garey1979,Henning2019} and they are probably very hard to solve in the general case, but there might still be hope if additional information is known. 
You look back into the map (\cref{fig:duck-lake}) and observe that none of the `quacking'-relations do cross with each other and you are getting curious if this can be used to build up something\ldots

\section{Content of the Thesis}

Emerged during the last two decades, \textit{parameterized complexity} is a well-established branch of modern theoretical computer science that showed many practical implications. 
In this thesis, we continue the systematic analysis of the \sdom problem through the lens of \textit{parameterized complexity}. 

% TODO Add last implication as soon as available
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Cref{ch:prelim} will give the necessary definitions in the fields of \textit{graph theory} and \textit{parameterized complexity}.
    \item In \cref{ch:semitotal-domination} we will discuss the \sdom problem and its relation to \dom and \tdom in more detail. 
    As they are closely related, we will gather the complexity status for various graph classes and compare them with each other in \cref{ch:complexity-status}. We will then show $\WTWO$-intractability for general, bipartite, split (and chordal) graphs.
    \item \Cref{ch:linkern} is the mainstay of this thesis. 
    We are going to construct a linear kernel for \psdom following an approach first suggested by Alber, Fellows and Niedermeier \cite{Alber2004}. 
    \item In \cref{ch:closing} we will give further ideas on how to improve the kernel and an outlook about interesting open problems for \sdom in general.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Our contributions}

While many authors have already stated positive results - for example, there exist polynomial-time algorithms for \emph{AT-free}, \emph{block} and \emph{interval} graphs as well as for \emph{graphs of bounded mim-width}, \emph{graphs of bounded clique-width} \cite{Kloks2021, Galby2020,Courcelle1990,Henning2022,Henning2019} - \NP-completeness was shown for various graph classes like general graphs, \emph{split}, \emph{planar}, \emph{chordal bipartite} and \emph{circle} graphs \cite{Henning2019, Kloks2021}.

%For example, there exist polynomial time algorithms for graphs of bounded mim-width \cite{Galby2020}, strongly chordal graphs \cite{Tripathi2021}, AT-free graphs \cite{Kloks2021} or interval graphs \cite{Henning2019}, \sdom restricted to bipartite graphs, chordal bipartite graphs, split graphs, planar graphs \cite{Henning2019}, circle graphs \cite{Kloks2021} and other graph classes remains \NPc.

We are going to further investigate these \NPc cases by applying the framework of \textit{parameterized complexity}. 
We could show $\WTWOhs$-intractability for general, bipartite, chordal, split and perfect graphs using parameterized reductions from \dom when parameterized by solution size.

In a groundbreaking paper, Alber, Fellows and Niedermeier \cite{Alber2004} first gave a linear kernel for \pdom. 
They recognized that a planar graph can be decomposed into a linear number of smaller regions. 
This motivated the introduction of local reduction rules that shrink the number of vertices in such a region to a constant size. 
Following up on this result, many other explicit linear kernels for dominating problems on planar graphs were found \cite{Guo2007, Garnero2017, Luo2013, Alber2006}. 
This has made us believe that we can also transfer such results to \psdom as well.
Our premonition turned out to be true and by adjusting the reduction rules given by Garnero and Sau \cite{Garnero2018}\footnote{We will rely on two different versions of this paper throughout the thesis. The \textit{arXiv} versions are explicitly marked.} for \ptdom, we were able to give an explicit kernel for \psdom of size $\kernelsize k$. 
More precisely, we are going to prove the following theorem:

\begin{restatable}[]{theorem}{centraltheo}\label{thm:central}
    The \sdom problem parameterized by solution size admits a linear kernel on planar graphs. There exists a polynomial-time algorithm that given a planar graph $(G, k)$, either correctly reports that $(G, k)$ is a NO-instance or returns an equivalent instance $(G', k)$ such that $\abs{V(G')} \leq \kernelsize \cdot k$.
\end{restatable}
