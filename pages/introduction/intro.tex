Quack! Quack! They were careless for a second and immediately the dreaded \textit{geesiosi} clan has taken the opportunity and conquered your befriended ducks' \textit{Merganser Lake}!
Now they are sitting on all the beautiful water lilies refusing to give them back and the desperate ducks have asked for your assistance.
The ducks have given you a map of the lake (see the left side of \cref{fig:duck-lake}) where all the water lilies are marked in green.
You instantly assured them of your help and started to analyze the situation!

You quickly noticed that the \textit{geesiosi} members are very frightened of the ducks' quacking. 
One single duck can free up an entire water lily and even drive away all the geese on neighboring plants! After thinking about this for a few minutes you realized that this might indeed be the key observation to regaining the lake. 
After some more deep contemplating, you came up with a good assignment of ducks to water lilies, where only a minimal number of ducks is required to liberate the whole territory again.

Happy with your idea, you present it to the \textit{Supreme Duck Decision Board}, but unfortunately, you could not fully convince them and the \textit{Chief Strategy Duck} shared her worries with you: 
They know that they also have to hold the fort and protect the lake against another future rush of the \textit{geesiosi}.
This is going to be a very tedious task for the individuals because a duck has to sit alone on a water lily waiting all day. They would rather want to have at least someone around to quack with together!

%____
You suggest them to revise your solution making sure that there is always another friend sitting at most two water lilies away. After a short retreat, you came up with a new solution where only two warrior ducks (see the right side of \cref{fig:duck-lake}) are required and they only have one lily in between. 

Now the ducks were fully satisfied with the solution! But while the chosen two ducks were being sent out over the water's surface, you were still thinking about the problem.
It looked so easy at first, but in the end, you had to try all the possible configurations while playing around with the number of ducks used (of course you did not tell the ducks that it was that simple, because they now think you are a wizard!). 
You are wondering, whether there is a way to significantly reduce the number of configurations you have to try to find a solution.

Back in your beloved library, you found in some ancient scrolls that this problem has already been formalized by Henning \cite{Henning2019} as the \sdom problem which is a variant of the intensively studied \dom problem. 
You read that both problems are \NPc~\cite{Garey1979,Henning2019} and they are probably very hard to solve.
%After already forshadowed by GÃ¶del \cite{Hartmanis1989} and Nash (CITE), 

The first results of \NPcn had been published independently by Cook \cite{Cook1971} in 1971 and Levin in 1973 \cite{Levin1973}. 
Karp \cite{Karp1972} had introduced the idea of problem reductions and had started to systematically reduce 19 other problems to each other showing that all of them are equally hard to solve: An efficient way to solve one of them will efficiently solve the others. Since then, thousands of problems were \NPc, among them \dom and \sdom. 
Up to today, the question of whether these \NPc problems can be solved efficiently remains an open problem, they write. 

Even though it is believed that they can't in the general case, there would still be hope if additional information about the underlying structure of the problem is known. 
Before solving the full problem it might be worth discovering parts that are easier than the rest and solving them first. You look back into the map (\cref{fig:duck-lake}) and see that there is one water lily that only had one neighbor.
Therefore, you have already been forced to assign a duck to one of those leaving you with a slightly simple map to be considered.

You now also saw that none of the `quacking'-relations do cross with each other and you become curious if you can do something\ldots

\section{Content of the thesis}

In this thesis, we continue the systematic analysis of the \sdom problem through the lens of \textit{parametrized complexity}.


%Not sure, whether the following should be here ... TODO Move away.
Introduced by Downey and Fellows \cite{Downey1999a}, parametrized complexity extends the classical theory with a framework that allows a more finely-grained analysis of computational problems. The idea is to measure a problem in terms of input size and an additional parameter $k$. This parameter denotes, how difficult the problem is: A larger parameter means a harder problem instance. We say that a problem is \textit{Fixed-Parameter Tractable} (FPT) if problem instances of size $n$ can be solved in $f(n)n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ time for some function $f$ independent of $n$. 

Although the \sdom problem has already got a lot of attention regarding classical complexity (CITE), only a few results are currently known for the parametrized variant. These results are given in \cref{ch:complexity-status}.

% Albers approach again?


% w intractability
Second we systematically 

% WRONG
As far as we have seen, even the w-hardness of the general case has not been explicitly proven in the literature. 

In this thesis, we continue the journey toward a systematic analysis by stating some hardness results for specific graph classes for the problem.

\paragraph{Our contributions}
% TODO Better: 

Our main contributions consist of first showing the $w[2]$-hardness of \sdom for XXXX graphs.

\noindent As the \dom problem and the \tdom problem both admit a linear kernel for planar graphs, it is interesting to analyze whether these results also hold for the \sdom problem which lies in between these two. 
%TODO by relxing the witness of these two provlemsproblems.

Having these kernels also for other variants like \eddom, \efdom, \cdom, \rbdom lent us great confidence that the result will also work for \sdom on planar graphs.

%% TODO Find more  .

Following the approach from ... which already relies on the technique given in, we give some simple data reduction rules for \sdom on planar graphs leading to a linear kernel. More precisely, we are going to prove the following central theorem of this thesis:

With some modifications, we were able to transfer the approach given by Garnero and Sau in \cite{Garnero2018} to the \sdom problem.

\begin{restatable}[]{theorem}{centraltheo}\label{thm:central}
    The \sdom problem parametrized by solution size admits a linear kernel on planar graphs. There exists a polynomial-time algorithm that given a planar graph $(G, k)$, either correctly reports that $(G, k)$ is a NO-instance or returns an equivalent instance $(G', k)$ such that $\abs{V(G')} \leq \kernelsize \cdot k$.
\end{restatable}
