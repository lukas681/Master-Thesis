%I have many people to thank for their tremendous support in this thesis, but I want to start with one person who made everything possible: my supervisor, \textit{Paloma}!
%Not only did you always have time for my questions and discussions but also showed such passion and enthusiasm for the problem to keep me motivated.
%Thank you also for fighting bureaucracy to make this stay possible and for all your efforts in the small side project of ``Finding him a Ph.D.''.
%
%Furthermore, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my professor at TUM, \textit{Prof. Ghoshdastidar} for instantly agreeing to formally supervise my thesis. 
%Your immediate willingness to take on this role and the uncomplicated communication was greatly appreciated!
%
%Furthermore, I would like to thank the whole algorithms group at ITU for letting me be a part of the group despite my status as a \textit{mere} Master student.
%From the moment I joined the group, you all made me feel welcome and integrated, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have done my thesis in such a friendly, helpful and productive environment.
%
%Special thanks go out to Jan Arne at UiB for introducing me to the fascinating world of parameterized Complexity and engaging me to further dig into this area! 
%
%% TODO Kann man das bringen?
%%Furthermore, thanks to all my proofreaders who provided me with very valuable feedback without even understanding a word of the thesis. 
%
%Lastly, I would like to thank openAI's \textit{chatGPT Dec 15} for writing this acknowledgments section and \textit{Dall-E 2} for the immense amount of creativity that went into the chapter's illustrations!
%What a time to be alive!
