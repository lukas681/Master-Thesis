% TODO: Idea for a nice introduction 

Idea:  Lake with stones, and family of ducks of fixed size wants to occupy the lake so that no other clan tries to take it over.
Rules: 
* A duck can quack freeing up neighboring stones.
* Ducks don't like to be alone and want to quack together. So for every duck their must be another duck that is not further than two stones away.
Q: Can our ducklings occupy the whole lake while not feeling lonely?


\section{Content of the thesis}

In this thesis we continue the systematic analysis of the \sdom problem by focusing on the parametrized complexity of the problem. 

Although the problem already had a lot of attention regarding classical complexity (CITE), only a few results are currently known for the parametrized variant. 

As far as we have seen, even the w-hardness of the general case has not been explicitly been proofen in the literature. 

In this thesis, we continue the journey towards a systematic analysis by stating some hardness results for specific graph classes for the problem.

\paragraph{Our contributions}
% TODO Better: 

Our main contributations consist of first showing the $w[2]$-hardness of \sdom for XXXX graphs.

\noindent As the \dom problem and the \tdom problem both admit a linear kernel for planar graphs, it is interesting to analyse wether this results also holds for the \sdom problem which lays in between these two. 
%TODO by relxing the witness of these two provlemsproblems.

Having these kernels also for other variants like \eddom, \efdom, \cdom, \rbdom lent us a great confidence that the result will also work for \sdom on planar graphs.

%% TODO Find more  .

Following the approach from ... which alraedy relies on the technique given in, we give some simple data reduction rules for \sdom on planar graphs leading to a linear kernel. More precisely, we are going to proof the following central theorem of this thesis:

With some  modifications we were able to transfer the approach given by Garnero and Stau in \cite{Garnero2018} to the \sdom problem.

\begin{restatable}[]{theorem}{centraltheo}\label{thm:central}
    The \sdom problem parametrized by solution size admits a linear kernel on planar graphs. There exists a polynomial-time algorithms that given a planar graph $(G, k)$, either correctly reports that $(G, k)$ is a NO-instance or returns an equivalent instance $(G', k)$ such that $\abs{V(G')} \leq \kernelsize \cdot k$.

\chapter{Preliminaries}
We start by recapping some basic notation in Graph Theory and Parametrized Complexity.

Continuing an intensive study of parametrized complexity of that problem. 

\section{Graph Theory}
We quickly state the following definitions given by {\cite[p.~xxx]{diestel10}}.

%% TODO Path, Subgraph, Induced Subgraph, Copnnected 
\begin{definition}[Graph {\cite[p. 3]{diestel10}}]
    A graph is a pair $G = (V, E)$ of two sets where $V$ denotes the vertices and $E \subseteq V \times V$ the edges of the graph.  A vertex $v \in V$ is incident with an edge $e \in E$ if $v \in e$. Two vertices $x, y$ are adjacent, or neighbours, if $\{x,y \} \in E$.
    % Size of the Graph?
\end{definition}

%TODO Quote
\begin{definition}[Vertex Degrees]
    The \textit{degree} $d_G(v)$ (If G is clear, also $d(v)$) of a vertex $v$ is the number of neighbors of v. We call a vertex of degree 0 as isoliated and one of degree 1 as a pendant.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[Special Graph Notations {\cite[p.~27]{diestel10}}]
    A simple Graph
    
    A directed Graph is a graph
    
    A Multi Graph
    
    A Planar Graph
\end{definition}

% TODO Quote e.g. The open neighborhood number of a graph
\begin{definition}[Closed and Open Neighborhoods {\cite{Balakrishnan2012}}]
    Let \G be a (non-empty) graph. 
    The set of all neighbors of $v$ is the \underline{open neighborhood} of $v$ and denoted by $N(v)$; the set $N[v] = N(v) \Cup \{v\}$ is the \underline{closed neighborhood} f $v$ in $G$. When G needs to be made explicit, those open and closed neighborhoods are denoted by $N_G(v)$ and $N_G[v]$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Induced Subgraph]
    asd
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Isomorphic Graph]
    asd
\end{definition}

\subsection*{Special Graph Classes}
We call the class of graphs without any special restrictions ``General Graphs''.

\begin{definition}[r-partite Graphs]
    Let $r \geq 2$ be an integer. A Graph $G = (V,E)$ is called ``r-partite'' if V admits a parititon into r classes such that every edge has its ends in different classes: Vertices in the same partition class must not be adjacent. 
    
    For the case $r = 2$ we say that the G is ``bipartite''
