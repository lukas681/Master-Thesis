\section{Content of the thesis}

In this thesis we continue the systematic analysis of the \sdom problem by focusing on the parametrized complexity of the problem. 

Although the problem already had a lot of attention regarding classical complexity (CITE), only few results are currently known for the parametrized variant. 

As far as we have seen, even the w-hardness of the general case has not been explicitely been proofen in the literature. 

In this thesis we continue the journey towards a systematic analysis by stating some hardness results for specific graph classes for the problem.

\paragraph{Our contributions}
% TODO Better: 

Our main contributations consist of first showing the $w[2]$-hardness of \sdom for XXXX graphs.

\noindent As the \dom problem and the \tdom problem both admit a linear kernel for planar graphs, it is interesting to analyse wether this results also holds for the \sdom problem which lays in between these two. 
%TODO by relxing the witness of these two provlemsproblems.

Having these kernels also for other variants like \eddom, \efdom, \cdom, \rbdom lent us a great confidence that the result will also work for \sdom on planar graphs.

%% TODO Find more.

Following the approach from ... which alraedy relies on the technique given in, we give some simple data reduction rules for \sdom on planar graphs leading to a linear kernel. More precisely, we are going to proof the following central theorem of this thesis:

With some  modifications we were able to transfer the approach given by Garnero and Stau in \cite{Garnero2018} to the \sdom problem.

\begin{definition}[Graph {\cite[p. 3]{diestel10}}]
A graph is a pair $G = (V, E)$ of two sets where $V$ denotes the vertices and $E \subseteq V \times C$ the edges of the graph.  A vertex $v \in V$ is incident with an edge $e \in E$ if $v \in e$. Two vertices $x, y$ are adjacent, or neighbours, if $\{x,y \} \in E$.

\chapter{A Linear Kernel for Planar Semitotal Domination}

\epigraph{\itshape The best way to explain it is to do it.}{Lewis Caroll, \textit{Alice in Wonderland}}

We are now building up towards a linear kernel for the \sdom problem. In order to achieve this, we will first split up the neighborhood of one vertice and a pair of vertices into three distinct subsets, give some nice properties on them and then state the corresponding reduction rules.  

% TODO: Reword

%TODO: SIZE of instance: Number of vertices.

But first, we would like to define what we consider to be a \textit{reduced} graph. 

\begin{definition}[Reduced Graph {\cite[p. 13]{Garnero2018}} and \cite{Garnero2017}]
    A Graph G is reduced under a set of rules if either none of these rules can be applied to G or the application of any of them creates a graph isomorphic to G.
\end{definition}\label{def:reduced}

In our case, we say G is reduced if none of the \cref{rgl:rone,rgl:rtwo,rgl:rthree} are modifying G any more.

This differs from the definition usually giving in literature where a graph G is \textit{reduced} under a set of reduction rules, if none of them can be applied to G anymore (Compare e.g. \cite{Fomin2019}). The reason is that we are giving reduction rules (see \cref{rgl:rone} or \cref{rgl:rtwo}) that could be applied \textit{ad infinitum} sending us into an endless loop without ever changing G any more. Our definition guarantees termination in that case.

From an algorithmic point of view, all our given reduction rules are local and only concern the neighborhood of at most two vertices and replace them partially with gadgets of constant size. Now checking wether a graph after applying the rule has beein changed can be trivially be accomplished in constant time.

\section{The Main Idea and The Big Picture}

[TODO SUM UP THE STRATEGY]


\section{Definitions}

In this section we are giving some key definitions that are used in our reduction rules for obtaining the linear kernel. These as inspired by those given by Garnero and Stau (\ptdom in \cite[]{Garnero2014} or \prbdom in \cite{Garnero2017a}) and already relied on those given by Alber et al. in \cite[]{Alber2004} for \pdom.

The idea is to split up the neighborhood of a single vertex and a pair of vertices into three (disjoint)  subsets that make a statement about how strongly the neighborhood is connected with the rest of the graph.

\begin{definition}
    \label{def:nv}
    Let \G be a graph and let $v \in V$. We denote by $N(v) = \{u \in V : \{u,v\} \in E \}$ the neighborhood of $v$. We split $N(v)$ into three subsets:
    \begin{align}
    N_1(v) &= \{u \in N(v) : N(u) \setminus N[v] \neq \emptyset \} \\
    N_2(v) &= \{u \in N(v)\setminus N_1(v) : N(u) \cap N_1(v) \neq \emptyset \} \\
    N_3(v) &= N(v) \setminus (N_1(v) \cup N_2(v))
    \end{align}
    In order to inhance future readability, for $i,j \in [1,3]$, we denote $N_{i,j} (v) := N_i(v) \cup N_j(v)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \label{fig:neighborhoodSingle}
    \begin{equation*}
        \tikzfig{fig/tikz/neighborhoods-single-vertex}
    \end{equation*}
\caption*{\textit{The neighborhood of a vertex splitted to $N_1(v)$ (blue), $N_2(v)$ (purple) and $N_3(v)$ (green). Note that all purple vertices have at least one blue neighbor making setting them in-between the green and blue vertices.}}
\end{figure}
% TODO Improve this description

Intuitvely, these sets are classifying neighbors of $v$ by how much they can interact with the rest of the graph and how much they are locally centered around $v$:

\noindent \textbf{$\mathbf{N_1(v)}$} are all neighbors of $v$ which have at least one adjacent vertex that is outside of $N(v)$ and therefore connect $v$ with the rest of the graph. They could possible belong to a solution.
% TODO What can they dominate

\noindent \textbf{$\mathbf{N_2(v)}$} are all neighbors of $v$ that have at least one neighbor from $N_1(v)$. These vertices do not have any function as a dominating vertex and can be seen as a \textit{buffer} bridging $N_1(v)$-vertices with those from $N_3(v) \cup \{ v \}$. Furthermore, they are useless as witnesses, because either we can replace them by $v$ (sharing the same neighborhood) or when being a witness for $v$, we replace it by one $z \in N_1(v)$.

% TODO This sentence? Every path to a vertex outside N(v) will take more than 2 steps. 
\noindent Vertices from $\mathbf{N_3(v)}$ are unmitigated sealed off from the rest of the graph. They are useless as dominating vertices: For all $z \in N_3(v)$ it holds that  $N(z) \subseteq N(v)$ by definition and thus, we would always prefer $v$ as a dominating vertex instead of $z$. Nevertheless, they can be important as a witness for $v$ in the case that $N_1(v) \cup N_2(v) =\emptyset $. We are using this observation in \cref{rgl:rone} where we shrink $\abs{N_3(v)} \leq 1$ 

In the following we are going to further extend this definition to a pair of vertices. Using this, \cref{rgl:rtwo} will later try to reduce the neighborhood of two vertices and similar to \ref{def:nv}, we can deduce some properties.

%TODO Where is it used?
\begin{definition}
    Let \G be a graph and $v,w \in V$. We denote by $N(v,w) = N(v) \cup N(w)$ the neighborhood of the pair $v,w$. We split $N(v,w)$ into three subsets:
    \begin{align}
    N_1(v,w) &= \{u \in N(v,w) \mid N(u) \setminus (N(v,w)\cup \{v,w\}) \neq \emptyset \} \\
    N_2(v,w) &= \{u \in N(v,w)\setminus N_1(v,w) \mid N(u) \cap N_1(v,w) \neq \emptyset \}\\
    N_3(v,w) &=  N(v,w) \setminus (N_1(v,w) \cup N_2(v,w))
    \end{align}
    Again, for $i,j \in [1,3]$, we denote $N_{i,j}(v,w) = N_i(v,w) \cup N_j(v,w)$.
\end{definition}

Again, $N_1(v,w)$ are those connected with the rest of the graph, $N_2(v, w)$ are a \textit{buffer} between $N_3(v,w) \cup \{v, w\}$ and $N_3(v,w)$ are those isolated from the rest of the graph, but can still be usefull as a witness for $v$ or $w$.

Note that for example a vertex $z \in N_1(v) \notimplies z \in N_1(v,w)$. Figure~\ref{fig:neighborhoodWeird} gives an example, where $z$ belongs to $N_1(v)$, but not to $N_1(v,w)$.

    \label{fig:neighborhoodWeird}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Regions in Planar Graphs}

We will introduce a concept that leads towards a new perspective looking at planar graphs, regions
% TODO Quote Alber et al.

As it is possible to bound the number of total $vw$-regions in a planar graph, we can analyse the local impacts to these regions from our future reduction rules. 

% TODO Maybe remove this.
It might be interesting to note that the authors of \cite{Garnero2017} have revised their original definitions to set the basic for a more formal analysis.

\begin{definition}
    Two simple paths $p_1, p_2$ in a plane graph G are \underline{confluent} if:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item they are vertex-disjoint
        \item they are edge-disjoint and for every common vertex $u$, if $v_i, w_i$ are the neighbors of $u$ in $p_i$, for $i \in [1,2]$, it holds that $[v_1, w_1, v_2, w_2]$, or
        \item they are confluent after contracting common edges
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

% TODO MORE TEXT HERE

\begin{definition}
    Let \G be a plane graph and let $v,w \in V$ be two distinct vertices. A \underline{$vw$-region} is a closed subset of the plane, such that:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the boundary of R is formed by two confluent simple $vw$-paths with length at most 3
        \item every vertex in R belongs to $N(v,w)$, and 
        \item the compliment of R in the plane is connected.
    \end{enumerate}

    We denote by $\partial R$ the boundary of R and by $V(R)$ the set of vertices which lie (with the plane embedding) in $R$. Furthermore, we call $\abs{V(R)}$ the \textit{size of the region}.

    The poles of R are the vertices $v$ and $w$. The boundary paths are the two $vw$-paths that form $\partial R$ 

\end{definition}


We now have all the definitions ready to formally define a decomposition technique for planar graphs:

\begin{definition}
    Two regions $R_1$ and $R_2$ are non-crossing, if:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $(R_1 \setminus \partial R_1) \cap R_2 = (R_2 \setminus \partial R_2) = \emptyset$, and 
        \item the boundary paths of $R_1$ are pairwise confluent with the ones in $R_2$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Given a plane graph \G and $D\subseteq V$, a \underline{$D-region$ Decomposition} of G is a set $\mathfrak{R}$ of regions with poles in D such that: 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item for any $vw$-region $R \in \mathfrak{R} $, it holds that $D \cap V(R) = \{v, w\}$, and
        \item all regions are pairwise non-crossing. 
    \end{enumerate}
    We denote $V(\mathfrak{R}) = \bigcup\limits_{R \in \mathfrak{R}} V(R)$. 
    
    A \textit{$D-region$ decomposition} is \underline{maximal} if there is no region $R \notin \mathfrak{R}$ such that $\mathfrak{R}' = \mathfrak{R} \cup \{R\}$ is a \textit{$D-region$ decomposition} with $V(\mathfrak{R}) \subsetneq V(\mathfrak{R}')$
\end{definition}




% TODO: Wording: "kernel" precise enough here.
We are introducing a special subset of a region, a \textit{simple region} where every vertex is a common neighbor of $v$ and $w$. They will appear on many unexpected astonishing places and are an important tool to operate on small parts of a plane graph. The upcoming \cref{rgl:rthree} will bound the size of these \textit{simple regions}.

\begin{definition}
    A simple $vw$-region is a $vw$-region such that:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item its bounary paths have length at most 2, and
        \item $V(R) \setminus \{v,w\} \subseteq N(v) \cap N(w)$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Figure \ref{fig:simpleRegionExample} shows an example of a simple region containing  9 vertices.

% TODO: Add colors here

\end{figure}

    % TODO for more examples refer to.
\section{Reduction Rules}

Following the approach by \cite{Garnero2014}, we are now stating reduction rules that after exhaustive application will expose a linear kernel. 

\subsection{Reduction Rule I: Getting Rid of unneccessary  $N_3(v)$ vertices}

\begin{rgl}\label{rgl:rone}
    Let \G be a graph and let $v \in V$. If $\abs{\Nthreev} \geq 1$:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item remove $\Nthreev$ from G, 
        \item add a vertex $v'$ and an edge $\{v, v'\}$
    \end{itemize}
     
\end{rgl}
\begin{lemma}
    Let \G be a a graph and let $v \in V$. If $G'$ is the graph obtained by applying \cref{rgl:rone}   on $V$, then G has SDS of size k if and only if G' has one.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
   This will be the proof for this lemma X 
\end{proof}

\cautionbox{Note, that we need our definition of a reduced instance given in \ref{def:reduced}. If \cref{rgl:rthree} is being applied, it will still leave us with a vertex $z\in N_3(v)$ allowing this rule to be applied again. }

\subsection{Reduction Rule II: Shrinking the Size of a Region}

% TODO: Force connectivity, improve kerne bound

% TODO: Reformulate
Extending the approach for a linear kernel for \dom proposed by Alber et al. in \cite{Alber2004}, Garnero and Stau transferred these results in \cite{Garnero2018} to the \tdom problem. 

%TODO: Better:
Their idea was to strengthen the reduction rules in such a way that the witness properties for total domination are being preserved.

% TODO Should we discuss that?
Following their approach in one of the first versions of \cite{Garnero2014}, we stating reduction rules that. Interestingly, the reduction rules given in the latest version of this paper was not directly be transferable to \sdom, but an older version giving slightly easier reduction rules could be adjusted to our problem.

which relies on the technique first introduced by Alber et al we try to reduce the neighborhood for two given vertices $v$ and $w$

Before we give the concrete reduction rule, we will define three sets 

\begin{align}
    \Dvw &= \{ \tilde D \subseteq N_{2,3}(v,w)            \mid N_3(v,w) \subseteq \bigcup_{v \in \tilde D} N(v),\ |\tilde D| \leq 3                  \}\\
    \Dv  &= \{ \tilde D \subseteq N_{2,3}(v,w) \cup \{v\} \mid N_3(v,w) \subseteq \bigcup_{v \in \tilde D} N(v),\ |\tilde D| \leq 3,\ v \in \tilde D \}\\
    \Dw  &= \{ \tilde D \subseteq N_{2,3}(v,w) \cup \{w\} \mid N_3(v,w) \subseteq \bigcup_{v \in \tilde D} N(v),\ |\tilde D| \leq 3,\ w \in \tilde D \}
    \end{align}

    %TODO Explain that more in detail. + Examples.



\begin{rgl}\label{rgl:rtwo}
    Let \G be a graph and two distinct $v,w \in V$. If $\Dvw = \emptyset$ we apply the following:
    \begin{caseof}
        \case{if $\Dv =  \emptyset$ and $D_w = \emptyset$}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Remove $N_{2,3}(v,w)$
            \item Add vertices $v'$ and $w'$ and two edges $\{v, v'\}$ and $\{w, w'\}$
            \item If there was a common neighbor of $v$ and $w$ in $N_{2,3}(v,w)$ add another vertex $y$ and two connecting edges  $\{v, y\}$ and $\{y, w\}$
        \end{itemize}
        \case{if $\Dv \neq  \emptyset$ and $D_w \neq \emptyset$}
        % TODO: If it can not be applied any more. Using R3 to reduce this      
        Do nothing\footnote{Originally, reduce Simple Regions [STAU]}

        \case{if $\Dv \neq  \emptyset$ and $D_w = \emptyset$}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Remove $N_{2,3}(v) \Cap N_3(v,w)$
            \item Add $\{v, v'\}$ 
        \end{itemize}

        \case{if $\Dv =  \emptyset$ and $D_w \neq \emptyset$} This case is symmetrical to \textbf{Case 3}. 
    \end{caseof}
\end{rgl}


Before proofing \cref*{rgl:rtwo} we will deduce some \textit{Facts} which are implied by the definitions above.

\begin{fact}
    Let \G be a graph, let $v,w \in V$, and let $G'$ be the graph obtained by the application of \cref*{rgl:rtwo} on $v,w$. If $\Dvw = \emptyset$, then G has a solution if and only if it has a solution containing at least one of the two vertices $\{v,w \}$.
\end{fact}
\begin{proof}
    
\end{proof}

Now we are ready to proof the correctness of \cref*{rgl:rtwo}

\begin{fact}
   Let \G be a graph, let $v,w \in V$, and let $G'$ be the graph obtained by the application of \cref*{rgl:rtwo} on $v, w$. If $\Dvw = \emptyset$ and $\Dv = \emptyset$ (resp. $\Dw = \emptyset$) then $G'$ has a solution if and only if it has a solution containing $v$ (resp. $w$).
\end{fact}
\begin{proof}
    
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    Let \G be a plane graph, $v, w \in V$ and \GB be the graph obtained after application of \cref{rgl:rtwo} on the pair $\{v, w\}$. Then G has SDS of size k if and only if G' has SDS of size k.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
   We will proof the claim by analysing the different cases seperately.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Reduction Rule III: Shrinking Simple Regions}
\begin{rgl}\label{rgl:rthree}
    Let \G be a plane graph, $v, w \in V$ and $R$ be a simple region between $v$ and $w$. If $\abs{V(R) \setminus \{v, w\}} \geq 7$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Remove $N_3(v,w)$
        \item Add two vertices $h_1$ and $h_2$ and four edges $\{v, h_1\}$, $\{v, h_2\}$, $\{w, h_1\}$ and $\{w, h_2\}$
    \end{itemize}
\end{rgl}
\begin{lemma}[Correctness of \cref{rgl:rthree}]
    Let \G be a plane graph, $v, w \in V$ and \GB be the graph obtained after application of \cref{rgl:rthree} on the pair $\{v, w\}$. Then G has SDS of size k if and only if G' has SDS of size k.
\end{lemma}

The application of \cref{rgl:rthree} gives us a bound on the number of vertices inside a \sr. 
\begin{corollary}
    Let \G be a graph, $v, w\in V$ and R a \sr~ between $v$ and $w$. If \cref{rgl:rthree} has been applied, this simple region has size at most 6.
\end{corollary}
% TODO Verify that
% TODO Maybe add a figure here.
\begin{proof}
    Clearly, if $\abs{V(R) \setminus \{v, w\}} < 7$ then the rule would not have changed G and the size of the region would already be bounded by 6.
    Asuming $\abs{V(R) \setminus \{v, w\}} \geq 7$ we note that every simple region can have at most two distinct vertices from $N_1(v,w)$ and two distinct ones from $N_2(v,w)$ without breaking planarity. These vertices are not touched by the reduction. Adding the two vertices that are being added between $v$ and $w$ gives us the desired upper bound.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Computing Maximal Simple Regions between two vertices}

For the sake of completeness, we state an algorithm how a maximal \sr between two vertices $v,w \in V$ can be computed in time $\mathcal{O}(d(v) + d(w))$:

    Let \G be a plane graph reduced under \cref{rgl:rone,rgl:rtwo,rgl:rthree}. Furthermore, let $D$ be a SDS of G and let $v,w \in D$. Any v-w-region R contains at most XXX vertices distinct from its poles.

\subsubsection{Number of Vertices outside the Decomposition}

\begin{lemma}[\#Vertices outside a Region]
Let \G be a plane graph reduced under \cref*{rgl:rone, rgl:rtwo} and let D SDS of G. If R has a maximal D-region decomposition then

% TODO: CITE ALBER AND STAU

% TODO Maybe, we can make that simpler? No proof really uses the fact that the graph is reduced. Note, that they do not use the notion of a reduced instance in the proof.

Alber et al. \cite[p. ]{Alber2004} constructed a greedy algorithm to construct a maximal D-region decomposition for a \dom. Building up on these results, Garnero and Stau gave decomposition procedures for \rbdom (\cite{Garnero2017a}) and \tdom (\cite{Garnero2018}), both relying on the same technique. 

Garnero and Stau (\cite[p. 15]{Garnero2014}) already mention that the decomposition does not rely on the 

At the same time, we are going to upper-bound the number of v-w-regions D can span. Will will now proof that this claim also holds for \sdom. 
% TODO Better english? to span

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[Proposition 1]{Garnero2014}}]
    Let G be a reduced plane graph and let D be a \sdom with $\abs{D}\geq 3$. There is a maximal D-region decomposition of G such that $\abs{R} \leq 3 \cdot \abs{D} - 6$
