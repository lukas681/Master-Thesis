For a graph \G, a set $E$ is called a \sdom, if $D$ is a dominating set and every vertex $v \in D$ is within distance two to another vertex $v' \in D$. The \msdom problem is to find a semi-total dominating set of minimum cardinality. The semitotal domination number $\gamma_{t2}(G)$ is the minimum cardinality of a semitotal dominating set and is squeezed between the domination number $\gamma(G)$ and the total domination number $\gamma_t(G)$.


After the problem was introduced by Goddard, Henning and McPillan in \cite{Goddard2014}, NP-completeness was shown for general graphs (\cite{Henning2019}), split graphs (\cite{Henning2019}), planar graphs (\cite{Henning2019}), chordal bipartite graphs (\cite{Henning2019}), circle graphs (\cite{Kloks2021}) and subcubic line graphs of bipartite graphs (\cite{Galby2020}). On the other side, there exist polynomial-time algorithms for AT-free graphs (\cite{Kloks2021}), \emph{graphs of bounded mim-width} (\cite{Galby2020}), graphs of bounded clique-width (\cite{Courcelle1990}), and interval graphs (\cite{Henning2019}).

In this thesis, we start the systematic look through the lens of \textit{parametrized complexity} by showing that \sdom is $\omega[2]$-hard for bipartite graphs and chordal graphs.
By applying the techniques proposed in \cite{Alber2004} and \cite{Garnero2018} for \dom and \tdom, we are going to construct a $\kernelsize k $ kernel for \sdom in planar graphs. This result further complements known linear kernels for other domination problems like \pcdom, \prbdom, \pefdom, \peddom, \idom and \pdirdom.
