% ACADEMIC
I have many people to thank for their support, but first and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor \textit{Paloma}!
Without our weekly discussions, your valuable ideas, patience and feedback, I would not have been able to write this thesis and have stayed motivated for such a long time.
Thank you for always having time for my questions!
Furthermore, without your initial crusade against the university's Erasmus policy, this stay would not have been possible at all and finally, thank you for all the effort into your side project of ``Finding him a Ph.D.''!
%

I would like to extend my gratitude to my professor at TUM, \textit{Debarghya} for instantly agreeing to formally supervise my thesis. 
Your immediate willingness to take on this role and the uncomplicated and instant communication was highly appreciated!
%

Furthermore, I would like to thank the whole \textit{Algorithms Group} at ITU for letting me be a part of the group.
From the moment I joined, you all made me feel welcome and integrated, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have written my thesis in such a friendly, helpful and productive environment.

Special thanks to \textit{Jan Arne} in Bergen for his introductory course into parameterized complexity. 
Without this course and your motivating feedback afterwards, I might not have tried to write my thesis in this area.

%% NON-ACADEMIC
Thank you to my \textit{family} for always being there for me and supporting me, regardless of how far I am away.

I'd like to acknowledge the assistance of my \textit{befriended ducks} and their quacky influence on some parts of the thesis.

Finally, I would like to thank openAI's \textit{ChatGPT Dec 15} for supporting me in writing this acknowledgments section and \textit{Dall-E 2} for the immense amount of creativity that went into the chapter's illustrations!
What a time to be alive!
