This chapter will introduce the core definitions used throughout this thesis. 
Most of the graph theory definitions are taken from~\cite{Diekert2005}. 
For definitions in the area of \textit{parameterized complexity}, the book by Cygan et al.~\cite{Cygan2015} gives an excellent introduction.
For standard mathematical notation, we refer the reader to any introductory textbook into discrete mathematics (e.g.,~\cite{Rosen2012}).
\section{Graph Theory}

If not explicitly stated otherwise, definitions follow the book \textit{Graph Theory}~\cite{diestel10}.

\subsection{Basic Terminology}

\begin{definition}[Graph]
    A simple graph is a pair $G = (V, E)$ of two sets where $V$ denotes the vertices and $E \subseteq V \times V$ the edges of the graph.  A vertex $v \in V$ is incident with an edge $e \in E$ if $v \in e$. Two vertices $x, y$ are adjacent, or neighbors, if $\{x,y \} \in E$. By this definition, graph loops and multiple edges are excluded.
    
    A multigraph is a pair $(V, E)$ of disjoint sets together with a map $E \rightarrow V \cup [V]^2$ assigning to every edge either one or two vertices, its ends. Multigraphs can have loops and multiple edges.
    
    We usually denote the vertex set by $V(G)$ and its edge set by $E(G)$.
\end{definition}

Unless stated otherwise, we usually consider only \textit{simple graphs}, but the notion of \textit{multigraphs} gets essential when we later talk about the \textit{underlying multigraph} of a \dreg. 

\begin{definition}[Subgraph and Induced Subgraph]
    Let \G and $G' = (V', E')$ be two graphs. If $V' \subseteq V$ and $E' \subseteq E$ then $G'$ is a \underline{subgraph} of $G$. 
    If $G$ is a subgraph of $G'$ and $G'$ contains all the edges to $G$ with both endpoints in $V(G')$, then $G'$ is an \underline{induced subgraph} of $G$, and we write $G' = G[V(G')]$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Degrees]
    Let \G be a graph. The \textit{degree} $d_G(v)$ (shortly $d(v)$ if $G$ is clear from the context) of a vertex $v \in V$ is the number of neighbors of v. 
    We call a vertex of degree $0$ \underline{isolated}, and one of degree $1$ a \underline{pendant}. 
    If all the vertices of $G$ have the same degree $k$, then $g$ is $k$-regular.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Closed and Open Neighborhoods {\cite{Balakrishnan2012}}]
    Let \G be a (non-empty) graph. 
    The set of all neighbors of $v$ is the \underline{open neighborhood} of $v$ and denoted by $N(v)$; the set $N[v] = N(v) \cup \{v\}$ is the \underline{closed neighborhood} f $v$ in $G$. When G needs to be made explicit, those open and closed neighborhoods are denoted by $N_G(v)$ and $N_G[v]$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Isomorphic Graphs]
Let \G and $G' = (V', E')$ be two graphs. We call $G$ and $G'$ \underline{isomorphic}, if there exists a bijection $\phi: V \rightarrow V'$ with $\{x, y\} \in E \Leftrightarrow \phi(x)\phi(y) \in E'$ for all  $x,y \in V$. Such a map $\phi$ is called \underline{isomorphism}.

If a graph $G$ is isomorphic to another graph $h$, we denote $G \cong H$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Paths and Cycles]
    A path is a non-empty graph $P = (V,E)$ of the form $V = \bigcup_{i  \in [k]} \{x_i\}$ and $E = \bigcup_{i \in  [k-1]} \{x_ix_{i+1}\}$ where all the $x_i$'s are distinct. 
    The vertices $x_0$ and $x_k$ are \underline{linked} by $P$ and are called the \textit{ends} of $P$. The \underline{length} of a path is its number of edges, and the path on $n$ vertices is denoted by  $P_n$. 
    We refer to a path $P$ by a natural sequence of its vertices: $P = x_0x_1...x_k$. Such a path $P$ is a path between $x_0$ and $x_k$, or a $x_0,x_k$-path.
    If $P = x_0...x_k$ is a path and $k \geq 2$, the graph with vertex set $V(P)$ and edge set $E(P) \cup \{x_kx_0\}$ is a \underline{cycle}. The cycle on $n$ vertices is denoted as $C_n$.
    The \underline{distance} $d_G(v,w)$ from a vertex $v$ to a vertex $w$ in a graph $g$ is the length of the shortest path between $v$ and $w$. If $v$ and $w$ are not linked by any path in $G$, we set $d_G(v,w) = \infty$. Again, if $G$ is clear from the context, we omit the subscripted $G$ and just write $d(v,w)$ instead.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Graph Classes}

A \textit{graph class} is a set of graphs sharing a common structural property.

\begin{definition}[Graph Parameters]
Let \G be a graph.
An  \underline{independent set} of $G$ is a set of pairwise non-adjacent vertices. 
A \underline{clique} of $G$ is a set of pairwise adjacent vertices. 
A \underline{vertex cover} of $G$ is a subset of vertices containing at least one endpoint of every edge. 
A \underline{dominating set} is a subset $D$ of vertices such that all vertices not contained in are adjacent to some vertex in $D$.
\end{definition}

\begin{graphclass}[r-partite]
    Let $r \geq 2$ be an integer. A Graph $G = (V, E)$ is called \underline{r-partite} if $V$ admits a partition into $r$ classes such that every edge has its ends in different classes: Vertices in the same partition class must not be adjacent. 
    A \textit{$2$-partite} graph is called \underline{bipartite}. 
    
    An $r$-partite graph in which every two vertices from different partition classes are adjacent is called \underline{complete}. For the \underline{complete bipartite graph} on bipartitions $X \uplus Y$ of size $m$ and $n$, we shortly write $K_{m,n}$. 
\end{graphclass}

\begin{graphclass}[Complete]
If all vertices of a graph \G are pairwise adjacent, we say that $G$ is \underline{complete}. 
A complete graph on $n$ vertices is a $K_n$. A $K_3$ is called a \underline{triangle}.
\end{graphclass}


%\begin{definition}[{\cite[IV. Triangulated Graphs]{Berge1966}}]
%    A graph G is called \textit{chordal} (or in the older literature \textit{triangulated}) graphs if for every cycle $c = [p_1,...,p_n,p_1]$ of length $l > 3$ there is an edge of $G$ joining two non-consecutive vertices of c. Such vertices are called chords of the cycle   
%\end{definition}

\begin{graphclass}[Chordal]
For a graph \G, an edge that joins two vertices of a cycle, but is not itself an edge of the cycle is a \underline{chord} of that cycle.

Furthermore, we say $G$ is \underline{chordal} (or \textit{triangulated}) if each of its cycles of length at least four has a chord. In other words, it contains no induced cycle other than triangles.

\end{graphclass}

\begin{graphclass}[Split]
A \underline{split graph} is a graph \G whose vertices can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set.    
\end{graphclass}

%\begin{graphclass}[Bipartite {\cite[p.5]{Bondy2008}}]
%A \textit{\bg} is a Graph G whose vertex set can be partitioned into two subsets X and Y, so that each edge has one end in X and one end in Y. Such a partition (X,Y) is called a \textit{bipartition} of G.
%\end{graphclass}

%\begin{definition}[Perfect Graphs]
    
%\end{definition}

\begin{graphclass}[Plane and Planar Graphs]

A \textit{plane graph} is a graph \G that can be drawn in such a way that no edges cross each other.

%\begin{itemize}
%    \item $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ (Vertices),
%    \vspace{-2mm}
%    \item Every edge is an arc between two vertices, 
%    \vspace{-2mm}
%    \item different edges have different sets of endpoints, and
%    \vspace{-2mm}
%    \item The interior of an edge contains no vertex and no point of any other edge
%\end{itemize}
A \underline{plane} graph is a planar graph together with a concrete drawing in the plane the \textit{plane embedding} of $G$. 
%A \textit{plane graph} can is a concrete \textbf{embedding} of the planar graph into the ``plane'' $\mathbb{R}^2$.

In connection with various chessboard problems, the concept of domination can be traced back to the mid-1800s.
For example, De Jaenosch attempted in 1862 to find the minimum number of queens required to fully cover an $n \times n$-chessboard~\cite{Jaenisch1862}.
Because of the immense amount of publications related to domination that followed, Haynes, Hedetniemi, and Slater started a comprehensive survey of the literature in 1998~\cite{Haynes1998, Haynes1998b}. 
Twenty years later, through a series of three more books, Haynes, Henning and Hedetniemi complemented the survey with the latest developments~\cite{Haynes2020, Haynes2021, Haynes2022}.

We are now introducing the problems of \dom, \sdom, and \tdom and dedicate the rest of the chapter to giving a current status about the complexity on various graph classes. 

\section{Domination Problems}

We will define this work's three most important domination problems: \dom, \sdom, and \tdom.
Recall that a dominating set of a graph \G is a subset $D \subseteq V$, such that every vertex from $V \setminus D$ is adjacent to some vertex in $D$.
We say that a vertex $d$ is a \textit{dominating vertex} or \textit{dominator} if $d \in D$ and that $d$ \textit{dominates} all of its neighbors.
Before defining the following problems, we give the following notion: 

\begin{definition}[Domination Numbers]
   The \underline{domination number} in a graph $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a dominating set (ds) of $G$, denoted as $\gamma(G)$. 
   The \underline{total domination number} is the minimum cardinality of a total dominating set (tds) of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_t(G)$.
   The \underline{semitotal domination number} is the minimum cardinality of a semitotal dominating set (sds) of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_{t2}(G)$.

   We say that a ds $D$ is \underline{minimal} if no proper subset $S' \subset S$ is a ds and that $D$ is a \underline{minimum} if it is the smallest ds.
\end{definition}


\begin{prb}[\MakeUppercase{\DOM}~{\cite[p. 586]{Cygan2015}}]{prb:ds}
    \begin{tabularx}{1.0\textwidth}{>{\hsize=0.30\hsize}X>{\hsize=0.8\hsize}X}
        \textbf{Input} & Graph \G, $k \in \mathbb{N}$\\
        \textbf{Question} & Is there a set {$D \subseteq V$} of size at most $k$ such that ${N[D] = V}$? \\
    \end{tabularx}
\end{prb}

The \dom problem asks for a subset $D$ of size at most $k$ whose set of neighbors are adjacent to all the other remaining vertices in a graph.
Assume that we have an arbitrary dominating set $D$ for some connected graph $G$ with at least two vertices.
For each $v \in D$, there must be at least one other dominating vertex $v' \in D$ that is at most three steps away.
Proven in \cref{fact:distance}, this motivates the definition of the following problem variants.

\begin{fact}\label{fact:distance} Let \G be a connected graph and $D$ a ds with $\abs{D} > 1$. 
For any $v_1 \in D$ there exists at least one other $v_2 \in D$ with $d(v_1,v_2) \leq 3$.
\end{fact}
\begin{proof}

Assume a ds $D$ and $v_1 \in D$ for which no other dominating vertex is in a distance less than three.
Then exists $v_2$ with $d(v_1,v_2) > 3$. 
By connectivity there is a path $p = (v_1, p_1, p_2, ...,  p_i, v_2)$ from $v_1$ to $v_2$ and no $p_i \in D $. 
For $D$ to be a valid ds, $p_2,...p_{i-1}$ have to be dominated by a neighbor as well, and therefore, there must exist a $u \in N(p_2) \cap D$ with $d(v_1, u) \leq 2$ giving a contradiction.
\end{proof}
We obtain the following variants if we lower the maximal allowed distance between two vertices in $D$.

Requiring every vertex $v \in V$ to have another direct neighbor in $D$ leads to the \tdom problem. 
We denote this neighbor as a \textit{witness} of $v$.

\begin{prb}[\MakeUppercase{\TDOM}~{\cite[p. 596]{Cygan2015}}]{prb:sds}
    \begin{tabularx}{1.0\textwidth}{>{\hsize=0.30\hsize}X>{\hsize=0.8\hsize}X}
        \textbf{Input} & Graph \G, $k \in \mathbb{N}$\\
        \textbf{Question} & Is there a ds $D \subseteq V$ of size at most $k$, such that for every $u \in V(G)$ there exists $v \in D$ with $\{u,v\} \in E$? \\
    \end{tabularx}
\end{prb}

It is natural to ask what happens if we restrict this distance property to be at most two, which leads us straight to the idea of \sdomin.
For a semitotal dominating set $D$, we say that $v$ \emph{witnesses} $v'$ if $v, v' \in D$ and $d(v,v') \leq 2$.
\sdomin was introduced by Goddard, Henning and McPillan~\cite{Goddard2014} as a relaxation of \tdomin. 

\begin{prb}[\MakeUppercase{\SDOM}~{\cite{Goddard2014}}]{prb:tsds}
    \begin{tabularx}{1.0\textwidth}{>{\hsize=0.30\hsize}X>{\hsize=0.8\hsize}X}
        \textbf{Input} & Graph \G, $k \in \mathbb{N}$\\
        \textbf{Question} & Is there a ds $D \subseteq V$ of size at most $k$, such that ${N[D] = V}$ and for all $d_1 \in D$ there exists another $d_2 \in D$ such that ${d(d_1, d_2) \leq 2}$?\\
    \end{tabularx}
\end{prb}

    \caption[An example for various dominating sets]{\textit{An example for a minimum dominating set, semitotal dominating set and a total dominating set, where $\gamma(G) < \gamma_{2t}(G) < \gamma_t(G)$ are strict. 
    In the first case, only two vertices suffice to dominate all others.
    In the second one, we need a witness between $d_1$ and $d_2$ at most distance two. 
    In the last case, $d_1$ and $d_2$ both need a neighbor in the total dominating set.}}
    \label{fig:dsexamples}
\end{figure}

Because any tds is also an sds and every sds is also a ds, $\gamma_{t2}$ is squeezed between $\gamma$ and $\gamma_t$.
The  following fact was first observed by Goddard and Henning~\cite{Goddard2014}:

\begin{fact}
For every graph $G$ with no isolated vertex, $\gamma(G) \leq \gamma_{t2}(G) \leq \gamma_t(G)$.
\end{fact}

There are graphs where this inequality is strict.
\Cref{fig:dsexamples} demonstrates that the minimum ds, sds, and tds can strictly differ in size on a fixed graph \G. 
A ds does not need witnesses, and we can choose two vertices $d_1$ and $d_2$ to dominate the graph; this is the only minimum solution.
As $d(d_1, d_2) = 3$, we have to introduce additional dominating vertices for a minimum sds (middle) and tds (right). 
Their only purpose is to bridge the gap between $d_1$ and $d_2$, but they have no function as dominators

\section{Complexity Status of \sdom}\label{ch:complexity-status}

Goddard et al.~\cite{Goddard2014} first showed that \SDOM is \NPc in the general case and initiated the systematic analysis of the problem.  
\cref{tab:complexities} complements the complexity status for \doms, \sdoms, and \tdoms when restricted to specific graph classes, which was first surveyed by Galby et al.~\cite{Galby2020}.
We also added another column showing the known parameterized complexity. 
\cref{fig:bigpicture} visualizes the big picture and the inclusions among the graph classes.

A polynomial-time algorithm was shown for graphs of bounded \textit{mim}-width by Galby et al.~\cite{Galby2020}.
Because a branch decompositions of constant \textit{mim}-width can be found for \textit{permutation}, \textit{convex}, \textit{interval}, \textit{(circular k-)} \textit{trapezoid}, \textit{circular permutation}, \textit{Dilworth-$k$}, \textit{$k$-polygon}, \textit{circular arc}, \textit{complements of $d$-degenerate}, \textit{bipartite permutation} and \textit{convex bipartite} graphs in polynomial time~\cite{Belmonte2011}, this algorithm immediately implies the existence of a polynomial time algorithm for these graph classes as well. 
Additionally, Galby et al. resolved the complexity for \textit{bipartite permutation} and \textit{convex bipartite} graphs.~\cite{Galby2020}

Furthermore, new polynomial time algorithms have been devised for \textit{strongly chordal}~\cite{Tripathi2021}, \textit{AT-free}~\cite{Kloks2021} and \textit{block}~\cite{Henning2022} graphs and a new linear time algorithm has been found for interval graphs~\cite{Pradhan2021} beating the previous $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$-algorithm given by Henning and Pandey~\cite{Henning2019}.
On the negative side, \sdom on \textit{circle graphs}~\cite{Kloks2021} graphs, and \textit{undirected path graphs}~\cite{Henning2019} was shown to be \NPc.

%As $\gamma_{t2}$ is squeezed between $\gamma$ and $\gamma_t$, a comparison of the computational complexity of \sdom and \tdom for specific graph classes on the dominating problems might also suggest the complexity of \sdoms.
There seems to be a symmetry between these three domination problems where the complexity of many graph classes mirrors each other, but it looks like \sdoms has more in common with \doms than with \tdoms.
For instance, \textit{chordal bipartite} graphs, \sdoms and \doms are \NPc, while it is polynomial-time solvable for \tdoms. 
Contrary, \sdoms and \doms have a polynomial-time algorithm for \textit{strongly chordal} graphs, but \tdoms is \NPc.
In all currently known cases, \sdom follows the complexity of \dom in the classical and the parameterized setting.

This thesis goes the first step into approaching the problem from the perspective of \textit{parameterized complexity}.
If not mentioned otherwise, the problem is always parameterized by the size of a solution.
We have also added the parameterized complexity for those graph classes which we used as an orientation for the complexities of \sdom.
%As we do not believe that \sdoms is fundamentally different than \doms, our intuition is that also the parameterized complexity mimicks \sdoms. 
We were able to prove \WTWO-hardness for \textit{bipartite} and \textit{split} graphs by giving parameterized reducing from \doms by solution size. We provide an explicit construction of a kernel for the \textit{planar} case, which exists for \doms~\cite{Alber2004} and \tdoms~\cite{Garnero2019} as well.

We would like to mention that membership of \psdom in \FPT already follows from~\cite{Alber2002}.
Their algorithm \pdomp can be used to obtain an fpt algorithm with running time $\mathcal{O}(c^{\sqrt{k}}n)$ for some constant $c$ and solution size $k$.
However, the constant is very large and we were able to give a kernel with reasonably small constants.

Many gaps are still open for further research.
We will discuss these questions at the end of this thesis in \cref{ch:closing}.
