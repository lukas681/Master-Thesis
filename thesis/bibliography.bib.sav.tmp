In particular, we prove that Dominating Set restricted to planar graphs has a so-called problem kernel of linear size, achieved by two simple and easy-to-implement reduction rules. Moreover, having implemented our reduction rules, first experiments indicate the impressive practical potential of these rules. Thus, this work seems to open up a new and prospective way how to cope with one of the most important problems in graph theory and combinatorial optimization.},

Although this problem does not admit a polynomial kernel for general graphs (unless NP⊆coNP/poly), for planar graphs Guo and Niedermeier [ICALP’08] showed a kernel with at most 14k vertices, subsequently improved by Wang et al. [MFCS’11] to 4k. The constant 4 here is so small that a natural question arises: could it be already an optimal value for this problem? In this paper we answer this question in the negative: we show a 113k-vertex kernel for Connected Vertex Cover in planar graphs. We believe that this result will motivate further study in the search for an optimal kernel. In our analysis, we show an extension of a theorem of Nishizeki and Baybars [Takao Nishizeki, Ilker Baybars, Lower bounds on the cardinality of the maximum matchings of planar graphs, Discrete Mathematics 28 (3) (1979) 255–267] which might be of independent interest: every planar graph with n≥3 vertices of degree at least 3 contains a matching of cardinality at least n≥3/3.},

We show that planar twinless graphs always contain an induced matching of size at least n/40 while there are planar twinless graphs that do not contain an induced matching of size (n+10)/27. We derive similar results for outerplanar graphs and graphs of bounded genus. These extremal results can be applied to the area of parameterized computation. For example, we show that the induced matching problem on planar graphs has a kernel of size at most 40k that is computable in linear time; this significantly improves the results of Moser and Sikdar (2007). We also show that we can decide in time O(91k+n) whether a planar graph contains an induced matching of size at least k.},

  abstract = {During the last years, several algorithmic meta-theorems have appeared (Bodlaender et al. [FOCS 2009], Fomin et al. [SODA 2010], Kim et al. [ICALP 2013]) guaranteeing the existence of linear kernels on sparse graphs for problems satisfying some generic conditions. The drawback of such general results is that it is usually not clear how to derive from them constructive kernels with reasonably low explicit constants. To fill this gap, we recently presented [STACS 2014] a framework to obtain explicit linear kernels for some families of problems whose solutions can be certified by a subset of vertices. In this article we enhance our framework to deal with packing problems, that is, problems whose solutions can be certified by collections of subgraphs of the input graph satisfying certain properties. \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal F\}\$\$-Packing is a typical example: for a family \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal F\}\$\$of connected graphs that we assume to contain at least one planar graph, the task is to decide whether a graph G contains k vertex-disjoint subgraphs such that each of them contains a graph in \$\$\{\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{F\}\}\}\$\$as a minor. We provide explicit linear kernels on sparse graphs for the following two orthogonal generalizations of \$\$\{\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{F\}\}\}\$\$-Packing: for an integer \$\${\textbackslash}ell {\textbackslash}geqslant 1\$\$, one aims at finding either minor-models that are pairwise at distance at least \$\${\textbackslash}ell \$\$in G (\$\${\textbackslash}ell \$\$-\$\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{F\}\$\$-Packing), or such that each vertex in G belongs to at most \$\${\textbackslash}ell \$\$minors-models (\$\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{F\}\$\$-Packing with\$\${\textbackslash}ell \$\$-Membership). Finally, we also provide linear kernels for the versions of these problems where one wants to pack subgraphs instead of minors.},

  abstract = {We show that for every fixed j ≥ i ≥ 1, the k-Dominating Set problem restricted to graphs that do not have Kij (the complete bipartite graph on (i + j) vertices, where the two parts have i and j vertices, respectively) as a subgraph is fixed parameter tractable (FPT) and has a polynomial kernel. We describe a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a Ki,j-free graph G and a nonnegative integer k, constructs a graph H (the “kernel”) and an integer k' such that (1) G has a dominating set of size at most k if and only if H has a dominating set of size at most k', (2) H has O((j + 1)i + 1 ki2) vertices, and (3) k' = O((j + 1)i + 1 ki2). Since d-degenerate graphs do not have Kd+1,d+1 as a subgraph, this immediately yields a polynomial kernel on O((d + 2)d+2 k(d + 1)2) vertices for the k-Dominating Set problem on d-degenerate graphs, solving an open problem posed by Alon and Gutner [Alon and Gutner 2008; Gutner 2009]. The most general class of graphs for which a polynomial kernel was previously known for k-Dominating Set is the class of Kh-topological-minor-free graphs [Gutner 2009]. Graphs of bounded degeneracy are the most general class of graphs for which an FPT algorithm was previously known for this problem. Kh-topological-minor-free graphs are Ki,j-free for suitable values of i,j (but not vice-versa), and so our results show that k-Dominating Set has both FPT algorithms and polynomial kernels in strictly more general classes of graphs. Using the same techniques, we also obtain an O(jki) vertex-kernel for the k-Independent Dominating Set problem on Ki,j-free graphs.},

  abstract   = {Preprocessing by data reduction is a simple but powerful technique used for practically solving different network problems. A number of empirical studies shows that a set of reduction rules for solving Dominating Set problems introduced by Alber, Fellows \& Niedermeier leads efficiently to optimal solutions for many realistic networks. Despite of the encouraging experiments, the only class of graphs with proven performance guarantee of reductions rules was the class of planar graphs. However it was conjectured in that similar reduction rules can be proved to be efficient for more general graph classes like graphs of bounded genus. In this paper we (i) prove that the same rules, applied to any graph G of genus g, reduce the k-dominating set problem to a kernel of size O(k+g), i.e. linear kernel. This resolves a basic open question on the potential of kernel reduction for graph domination. (ii) Using such a kernel we improve the best so far algorithm for k-dominating set on graphs of genus ≤ g from \$2{\textasciicircum}\{O(g{\textbackslash}sqrt\{k\}+g{\textasciicircum}\{2\})\}n{\textasciicircum}\{O(1)\}\$to \$2{\textasciicircum}\{O({\textbackslash}sqrt\{gk\}+g)\}+n{\textasciicircum}\{O(1)\}\$. (iii) Applying tools from the topological graph theory, we improve drastically the best so far combinatorial bound to the branchwidth of a graph in terms of its minimum dominating set and its genus. Our new bound provides further exponential speed-up of our algorithm for the k-dominating set and we prove that the same speed-up applies for a wide category of parameterized graph problems such as k-vertex cover, k-edge dominating set, k-vertex feedback set, k-clique transversal number and several variants of the k-dominating set problem. A consequence of our results is that the non-parameterized versions of all these problems can be solved in subexponential time when their inputs have sublinear genus.},

  abstract  = {The domination number of a graph G = ( V , E ) is the minimum size of a dominating set U V , which satisfies that every vertex in V U is adjacent to at least one vertex in U . The notion of a problem kernel refers to a polynomial time algorithm that achieves some provable reduction of the input size. Given a graph G whose domination number is k , the objective is to design a polynomial time algorithm that produces a graph G whose size depends only on k , and also has domination number equal to k . Note that the graph G is constructed without knowing the value of k . All the constructions in this paper are of monotone kernels , that is, the kernel G is a subgraph of the input graph G . Problem kernels can be used to obtain efficient approximation and exact algorithms for the domination number, and are also useful in practical settings. In this paper, we present the first nontrivial result for the general case of graphs with an excluded minor, as follows. For every fixed h , given a graph G with n vertices that does not contain K h as a topological minor, our O ( n 3.5 + k O (1)) time algorithm constructs a subgraph G of G , such that if the domination number of G is k , then the domination number of G is also k and G has at most k c vertices, where c is a constant that depends only on h . This result is improved for graphs that do not contain K 3, h as a topological minor, using a simpler algorithm that constructs a subgraph with at most ck vertices, where c is a constant that depends only on h . Our results imply that there is a problem kernel of polynomial size for graphs with an excluded minor and a linear kernel for graphs that are K 3, h -minor-free. The only previous kernel results known for the dominating set problem are the existence of a linear kernel for the planar case as well as for graphs of bounded genus. Using the polynomial kernel construction, we give an \$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{3.5\} + 2{\textasciicircum}\{O({\textbackslash}sqrt\{k\})\})\$ time algorithm for finding a dominating set of size at most k in an H -minor-free graph with n vertices. This improves the running time of the previously best known algorithm.},

In this paper, we give a kO(dk)n time algorithm for finding a dominating set of size at most k in a d-degenerated graph with n vertices. This proves that the dominating set problem is fixed-parameter tractable for degenerated graphs. For graphs that do not contain Kh as a topological minor, we give an improved algorithm for the problem with running time (O(h))hkn. For graphs which are Kh-minor-free, the running time is further reduced to (O(log h))hk/2n. Fixed-parameter tractable algorithms that are linear in the number of vertices of the graph were previously known only for planar graphs. For the families of graphs discussed above, the problem of finding an induced cycle of a given length is also addressed. For every fixed H and k, we show that if an H-minor-free graph G with n vertices contains an induced cycle of size k, then such a cycle can be found in O(n) expected time as well as in O(n log n) worst-case time. Some results are stated concerning the (im)possibility of establishing linear time algorithms for the more general family of degenerated graphs.},

  abstract = {A total dominating set of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a subset $D \subseteq V$ such that every vertex in $V$ is adjacent to some vertex in $D$. Finding a total dominating set of minimum size is NP-hard on planar graphs and W[2]-complete on general graphs when parameterized by the solution size. By the meta-theorem of Bodlaender et al. [J. ACM, 2016], there exists a linear kernel for Total Dominating Set on graphs of bounded genus. Nevertheless, it is not clear how such a kernel can be effectively constructed, and how to obtain explicit reduction rules with reasonably small constants. Following the approach of Alber et al. [J. ACM, 2004], we provide an explicit kernel for Total Dominating Set on planar graphs with at most $410k$ vertices, where $k$ is the size of the solution. This result complements several known constructive linear kernels on planar graphs for other domination problems such as Dominating Set, Edge Dominating Set, Efficient Dominating Set, Connected Dominating Set, or Red-Blue Dominating Set.},

The Minimum Semitotal Domination problem is to find a semitotal dominating set of minimum cardinality. Given a graph G and a positive integer k, the Semitotal Domination Decision problem is to decide whether G has a semitotal dominating set of cardinality at most k. The Semitotal Domination Decision problem is known to be NP-complete for general graphs. In this paper, we show that the Semitotal Domination Decision problem remains NP-complete for planar graphs, split graphs and chordal bipartite graphs. We give a polynomial time algorithm to solve the Minimum Semitotal Domination problem in interval graphs. We show that the Minimum Semitotal Domination problem in a graph with maximum degree Δ admits an approximation algorithm that achieves the approximation ratio of 2+3ln⁡(Δ+1), showing that the problem is in the class log-APX. We also show that the Minimum Semitotal Domination problem cannot be approximated within (1−ϵ)ln⁡|V| for any ϵ>0 unless NP ⊆ DTIME (|V|O(log⁡log⁡|V|)). Finally, we prove that the Minimum Semitotal Domination problem is APX-complete for bipartite graphs with maximum degree 4.},

We will present original NP-completeness results, some of which are new, and others which are simpler proofs of existing NP-completeness results (see Table 2 and Table 3 in Chapter 6). All of the proofs of these results are no longer than two pages; most are less than one page long. The great majority of these results use reductions from the Exact Cover by 3 Sets problem and use a common graph construction. The full generality of this technique has not been fully developed and we suggest a number of "open" problems that may be shown NP-complete by applying similar techniques.},

If a boolean decomposition of width w is given, several NP-complete problems, such as Maximum Weight Independent Set, k-Coloring and Minimum Weight Dominating Set are solvable in O*(2O(w)) time [6]. In this paper we study graph classes for which we can compute a decomposition of logarithmic boolean-width in polynomial time. Since 2O(logn)=nO(1), this gives polynomial time algorithms for the above problems on these graph classes. For interval graphs we show how to construct decompositions where neighborhoods of vertex subsets are nested. We generalize this idea to neighborhoods that can be represented by a constant number of vertices. Moreover we show that these decompositions have boolean-width O(logn). Graph classes having such decompositions include circular arc graphs, circular k-trapezoid graphs, convex graphs, Dilworth k graphs, k-polygon graphs and complements of k-degenerate graphs. Combined with results in [1,5], this implies that a large class of vertex subset and vertex partitioning problems can be solved in polynomial time on these graph classes.},

Their runtime is polynomial in the number of equivalence classes of problem-specific equivalence relations on subsets of vertices, defined on a given decomposition tree of G. Using these algorithms all these problems become solvable in polynomial time for many well-known graph classes like interval graphs and permutation graphs (Belmonte and Vatshelle (2013) [1]). Given a decomposition of boolean-width k we show that the algorithms will have runtime O(n^42^O^(^k^^^2^)), providing the first large class of problems solvable in fixed-parameter single-exponential time in boolean-width.},

Keil [Discrete Applied Mathematics, 42(1):51-63, 1993] proved that Dominating Set, Connected Dominating Set, and Total Dominating Set are NP-complete in circle graphs. To the best of our knowledge, nothing was known about the parameterized complexity of these problems in circle graphs. In this paper we prove the following results, which contribute in this direction:· Dominating Set, Independent Dominating Set, Connected Dominating Set, Total Dominating Set, and Acyclic Dominating Set are W[1]-hard in circle graphs, parameterized by the size of the solution.· Whereas both Connected Dominating Set and Acyclic Dominating Set are W[1]-hard in circle graphs, it turns out that Connected Acyclic Dominating Set is polynomial-time solvable in circle graphs.· If T is a given tree, deciding whether a circle graph has a dominating set isomorphic to T is NP-complete when T is in the input, and FPT when parameterized by |V(T)|. We prove that the FPT algorithm is subexponential.},

Our results prove that unless NP=P, the minimum dominating set in a chordal or s -chordal ( s &gt;3) graph cannot be approximated within a ratio of $frac{c}{3}ln{n}$ in polynomial time, where n is the number of vertices in the graph and 0&lt; c &lt;1 is the constant from the inapproximability of the minimum dominating set in general graphs. In other words, our results suggest that restricting to chordal or s -chordal graphs can improve the approximation ratio by no more than a factor of 3.

Undirected path graphs are an intermediate class of graphs, defined as the intersection graphs of paths of a tree. It is known that Dominating Set, Connected Dominating Set, and Steiner Tree are W[2]-hard on chordal graphs, when parameterized by the size of the solution, and are polynomial-time solvable on interval graphs. As for the undirected path graphs, all these problems are known to be NP-complete, and when parameterized by the size of the solution, no classification in the parameterized complexity theory is known apart from the trivial XP classification. We prove that Dominating Set, Connected Dominating Set, and Steiner Tree are FPT for undirected path graphs when parameterized by the size of the solution, and that they continue to be FPT for general chordal graphs when parameterized by the size of the solution plus the vertex leafage of the graph, provided a tree model with optimal vertex leafage is given. We show a relation between the parameterization of Min-LC-VSP problems by the leafage of the graph versus the vertex leafage plus the size of a solution.},
